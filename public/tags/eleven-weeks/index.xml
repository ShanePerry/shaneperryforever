I asked Jehovah, if Shane was going to need help with speech again, and if it could help having the person who taught him to speak in the first place, Betty, could He touch the heart of Bill, as a father, to make a sacrifice and accept any caregiver she could find. The next time we could explain it to Shane, wouldn’t he be pleased to hear that his dad made a huge unselfish sacrifice for him. I didn&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone about the prayer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The nurse put soft music on his patient&amp;rsquo;s radio/call button. His vitals were all within range. CPP was low. Lauren the infirmary nurse was with me and she explained how they calculate CPP from ICP + MAP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1000-am&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;10:00 AM &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#1000-am&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaz the NP came to explain they would raise the CPP with medication soon. She also gave a road map about the upcoming tracheostomy and feeding tube procedures to guarantee definite access to his airway and stomach. She said Shane would also be spiking fevers over the next few days. They would use antibiotics and chest x-rays to prevent pneumonia, especially while he was on the ventilator. I thanked her and said I was in awe of how the nurses manage the vitals and respond quickly. It’s like watching a symphony of many things all going on at once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There was a light in their eyes that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before. They said Shane improved today. He began localizing. Specifically, early in the morning when they moved him in the lift, his hand reached out and gripped the handrail of the bed. Although his eyes were still closed, he sensed his movement in the air and made an attempt to stabilize himself. He was now a 7T. T because he was non-verbal due to the breathing tube. Sara the PA said she would ask the team about getting an EEG and an MRI to see how the hemorrhaging and midline shift was doing. They also removed the bolt from his skull that was monitoring his ICP. Now that it was out, he could have an MRI. I asked if it was less likely now to need to discuss Shane&amp;rsquo;s end of life wishes. She said, yes, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t likely to need that. The doctors would have told us by now if they knew that he was in that condition. They said he is in no way hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was moving his left side more, and nothing on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1000-am&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;10:00 AM &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#1000-am&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olivia arrived. The airbnb and the car rental didn’t work out well. We asked if there was any chance for last minute accommodation. Josh and Justin got it worked out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He had started bending his left leg at the knee letting it hang off the bed, likely because it felt better to him to get pressure off the wound on his left foot. But, he couldn’t pick the leg back up and rest it on the bed again. It just dangled there, putting pressure on the skin on back of his knee. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want a pressure wound there too, so we went back and forth for the rest of the day with him pushing his leg off the bed and me lifting it back up onto the bed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She did a bladder scan. He was starting to hold it because each day he was more aware of his situation, for example, he knew if was in a bed or a chair, therefore, he was holding it to not soil anything. I told him that they had set up the Purwick catheter and I pointed to a tank on the wall and explained that everything would be suctioned away to that tank in the wall. There was no way anything would be soiled. He mouthed, “It’s ok?” I said “Yes, for sure it’s ok.” He understood and didn’t have a problem after that. It was good to see he was more and more aware of what he would normally do as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She and Debi said they want to come back. Especially when Shane is settled in rehab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1100am&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;11:00am &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#1100am&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane had a new doctor. Ilya Shanaydman MD. He said they would continue working on trach collar and get him independent from the vent. They were still using it periodically through the night. The swelling left side of his head had reduced around the opening in the skull. But some more fluid was accumulating in the space between his left eye and ear. They would have an ENT specialist see him. The Holter monitor result didn&amp;rsquo;t capture anything.&#xA;They had requested a larger chair but they don&amp;rsquo;t have one. He could get up on his own from the side of the bed during PT with minimal assistance. Shane would be sent for a follow up with Cardiology and given a two week monitor for arrhythmia, once he could handle the appointment. Maybe after rehab. They would check him for vagal episodes, tilt table testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

HCD, Chivonne also confirmed this was the best rehab option so we should go for it first. For inpatient rehab there were two different levels of care. Acute, intense short. 3 hrs of OT PT lasting about 2-3 weeks long. Or sub acute, slower schedule for therapy and lasting a longer period of time, 2-3 months. They were applying for acute care for Shane because they could project that he was progressing rapidly. Helen Heyes was 13 miles from Warwick. As a coincidence it was in our congregation territory. So we knew it well, although we’d never been there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another good day 😊&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He stood again and took two steps. He lead with his left leg while the right leg supported him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And Shane spoke! ☺️&#xA;Speech therapy came and tested a speaking valve on the trach. He answered various questions saying:&#xA;“Ahhh”&#xA;“Yes”&#xA;“Ok”&#xA;“I think New Jersey” (when she asked where he was)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am so happy about this! The first time I hear his voice in 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Watched NFL.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Had some great visits with Andy &amp;amp; Sherri. Uros &amp;amp; Kati. Jules from PVG, Chris &amp;amp; Avonda from HLC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today was a holiday so the rehab processing will continue tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The message is short but the day was full of good things. Shane is recovering at top speed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another good day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane is moving to Neuro step down tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plans continue for Helen Heyes rehab Tuesday or Wednesday, pending approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane stood with PT sat in the recliner 10:00-4:30&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Breathing the wall o2. And sometimes without that, just natural room air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Celestina the bethel nurse says blood tests are good. Hemoglobin up to 9.6.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swelling on his head is way down. No fever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He loved seeing Jeremy and Youn today. He put back on Andy&amp;rsquo;s hat 💕 Had a visit and spiritual gem from Chris Fairley.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another good day! 😌&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane&amp;rsquo;s new floor is very good. He&amp;rsquo;s beside two large windows. The room is very quiet and the nurse station is right there. Guest limit is still 2 people. And you wait in the Main Lobby until they agree you can come up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They hope to begin using the speaking cap. Shane is talking as much as he can right now. He asked me a few questions and the nurse helped make it easier to hear him. It will be even easier for him with the speaking valve on.&#xA;So we are looking forward to that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even better than yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane got good rest today. Watched the July Broadcast, a few shows he likes and got to hear about Ramapo from Solon. He really seemed to be interested in that. When Solon&amp;rsquo;s iPad buffered during a video…Shane reached up and swiped it, to move on to the next picture. ☺️&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No physical therapy today, but he made the most of the extra rest&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speech therapy came for the speaking valve and swallowing test but he was sleeping so decided to do the test tomorrow morning after a night&amp;rsquo;s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane stood up from the edge of the bed with PT again. I actually got to see it ☺️ He stood and pivoted to the recliner. He sat for a while, and held the toothbrush and used it himself but wanted to go back to the bed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once he was back in the bed, I told him how great it was that he got up and moved over and back, even though he didn&amp;rsquo;t stay in the recliner very long (it&amp;rsquo;s too small for him) He told me “don&amp;rsquo;t worry” 😅&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our best day yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane moved to Helen Hayes rehab today. They had given the idea that it would be Wednesday, but then at 11:30 they gave us the good news that it was all approved.&#xA;3:00pm the ambulance came.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a good trip. Both the paramedics took JW.ORG contact cards. The young woman said she just started reading the Bible in Genesis. And took our contact info.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane could speak more and asked many more questions. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the swallow test and speaking valve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shane got 3 hours of therapy today. Two hours in the morning. 1 hour in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was good, calm &amp;amp; tired but also the activity seemed to promote his staying awake and he asked many questions today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trach is capped again and they are in the capping process to prepare for removal. The cap makes it much easier for him to speak&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;👏 At one point he reached for my hand and said “Just talk to me.” ☺️&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shane got 3.5 hours of therapy today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Physical therapy used the wheelchair and he went to the physical therapy room with a huge window and a view of the Hudson River.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speech therapy helped him call my name out loud, “Vanessa” and I walked in the room on his request. The first time he says my name in 24 days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He also repeated my name this evening at my request.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shane got 3.5 hours of therapy today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He transferred to the chair. Sam and I played a card game with him. We played War and he took every trick but the last. We tied and then I had the last high card. 💗&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He also went to the PT room and then went to a hallway where they practiced standing and sitting and taking steps. He did great. And insisted that he lift himself by pushing off the armrests of the chair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shane had 3 hours of therapy today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also ate three full meals which he really liked. They asked if he wanted to eat, he said “Let&amp;rsquo;s do it!”&#xA;The nurse said soon, we can even bring some food from outside that he likes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had great conversations. He asked even more questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He joined the nurses when they started asking me where I&amp;rsquo;m from and what I do for work. He also spontaneously called me by my nickname, “cheekies” for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A great day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane had 1.5 planned hours of OT. Sunday schedule is lighter. But after that Chivonne and I got to take him OUTSIDE!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we were outside, I asked to hold his hand…he said, “because you are nervous”&#xA;😅 He&amp;rsquo;s right, I was. It was just first time going out for 28 days. But everything went really well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was really great. The fresh air and sunlight were so relaxing. He finally got to see a little more of the hospital. He also could hear the live music artist in the main lobby.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another good day&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane had 3 hours of therapy. They used the rails in the gym to get him walking on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He also began transfers to the bathroom in his room. Two nurses stand on each side of him, he lifts himself up from the side of the bed and takes steps on his own into the restroom. The nurses are there on both sides in case he needs help steadying himself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He got Chick-fil-A! 🤗&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Speech Therapist, Karl, upgraded him to solid food today, including outside food. So the Taylors stopped at Chick-fil-A for him. He also ate some of the hospital dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After dinner he was very content and told Sam, “Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just take a nap. You can take a nap too if you want.” I told stories of his Bible students in Nicaragua and he later fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had our first prayer together in 30 days! Shane prayed for us before dinner tonight. 🙏 It was so good!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sofia Dominguez brought him Five Guys and the Giambras brought me chicken salad. He loved the burger and fries!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We told him that the previous evening, the nurse, Sastía, asked if we believe in Jesus and that we had a good conversation. He said, “That&amp;rsquo;s good, We&amp;rsquo;re close to the end.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another good day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I called Shane at 8:30am.&#xA;He remembered me leaving last night. He asked if the same couple would bring me back today. He asked if Leah is getting better.&#xA;His short term memory is at hard at work.&#xA;🤗🤗&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We looked at family photos and his early Bethel days. He said a lot of things were familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He did well during a numbers portion of a test in Occupational Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He had a good but intense morning session of PT/OT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speech therapy worked on writing today. He signed his name. They gave us a few bonus writing pages to work on over the weekend since sessions are reduced those two days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The clerk in Wing 3A, Shirley, came and told us that she goes to the Stoney Point congregation. 😅😅 We had no idea. She&amp;rsquo;s been helping us for 1.5 weeks. But today was the first time that she noticed the Caleb and Sofia poster. 👏 She said when she saw that, she knew we were witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He had less activities today, so there was extra time for social and rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the phone this morning I said they&amp;rsquo;d probably be bringing him breakfast soon. He said ‘No, we already finished it. I don&amp;rsquo;t think they have tons and tons of food.’&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When he stands now at the sink to watch his hands, he is very stable and spreads his feet a good distance apart to keep steady.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was good!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I called him during breakfast he said, &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re gonna take the tray soon, do I need to save any of this breakfast for you?&amp;rdquo; 💙&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived they transferred him to the chair for lunch. He said &amp;ldquo;I want to be over there with Vanessa&amp;rdquo; I who was looking out the window sitting on the AC unit block.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During lunch, we played Coastline by Hollow Coves. A few times he asked, “Tell me something new.” We watched a morning worship video and a recording by the Taylor family. He asked when and where they were when they recorded it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A great day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He walked over 250 feet. PT was helping him on both sides, and another PT pushed the chair behind him, just in case he needed to rest. Leah and I got to watch in the hallway. He climbed stairs in the gym!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They stopped the overnight feeding. They may remove the peg tube at the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His left eye is opening wider and seems also to be focusing more clearly on things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another good day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We got to watch Shane as he worked out both legs on the step. He was very steady.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane is doing well with the therapy routine. Today when the physical therapist came, he said “Let&amp;rsquo;s do it!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later he told us, “I&amp;rsquo;m not at my full potential. It&amp;rsquo;s coming…just slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had a great day with Betty and delicious meals from friends 💙&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;rsquo;t have much strength for visits and asked that we just let him sleep a few times although he said, “You can keep talking.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 38. Another good day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I stayed home to rest. I felt regret for that, but Leah said when you do the modest thing, it usually feels better later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These notes are from Chivonne and Betty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;12:05- We arrived and immediately the front staff knew exactly who we were there for and smiled when we arrived!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane was napping when we arrived but soon woke up and we got him set up to eat lunch! He is super alert today and he remembered me!! 🥹🥹 He was so glad you were taking a day and said &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful wife and needs rest too&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shane&#xA;“If I cover right eye, the left eye is good.&#xA;Cover the left eye, the right eye is ok.&#xA;Uncover them both, they are mixed up.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another good day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During our 8:30am call, he asked who the gentleman is that comes and sees him. He asked if he was making decisions about his care. Later we confirmed that it was his Doctor. Dr. Seliger, the Neurologist. He does rounds early in the morning and now Shane is starting to remember his visits. He didnt think he answered all the questions right. But he did get July right today! 👏 Truthfully without a phone, most of us might only get the month right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And as they took the breakfast tray, he said they needed to save something for Vanessa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;12:00 I came in and he was trying to pronounce my name. He said…”Tell me, what is the noun for you?” I told him “Do you mean my name, Vanessa?” He said, “Yes” He closed his eyes and said, &amp;quot; I have to repeat this, Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shane had a great day. No scheduled therapy so he had a great nap in the morning &amp;amp; early afternoon and some visits in the late afternoon/evening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kristine the RN talked about Shanes upcoming CT scan at Good Samaritan. She said they usually send patients for CT scan in the stretcher so that they don&amp;rsquo;t wait as long at the hospital. If they send the patient in a wheelchair, the patient waits longer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Please keep them safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1:00pm we watched the meeting together 🙏 he had to rest his eyes a while, but he asked me to keep it on and turn the volume up. One time I got up to put away the clean laundry and asked me why I wasnt sitting and I should just set and enjoy it. 😅👏&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;8:30 I called him. He had a good night. He was waiting for breakfast and physical therapy. He said that Physical Therapy is &amp;ldquo;the hard one, she&amp;rsquo;s always got stuff for me to do.” We practiced the date and he got July correct! Still working on the day itself. He was happy Betty is home safe. And liked hearing about Kev’s work in the basement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;9:00am&#xA;Walked 800ft with the walker&#xA;Walked 100ft with PT assist&#xA;Walked over hurdles.&#xA;Laurell noticed Shane has double vision and was heading to the right of the hurdles. She said she&amp;rsquo;ll let Dr. Seliger know. Also they may use eye patches to help with double vision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;8:30 I called him. He asked me how my night was. He said he was pretty sure therapy was going to start soon. According to the schedule I saw later, it was Speech Therapy with Karl. Before we hung up, we rehearsed the date, July 30. He did great with July. Every night, we mark the days off a large print calendar that I got on Amazon and hung beside the bed. That has helped him remember the month, July.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;8:10 I called him. First thing he said was, “How was your night, cheekies?” He said he slept well and sounded very refreshed. We rehearsed the date and he said, “July 17, did I get it right?” I said he got the month, July, right, but the day is 31. He repeated it and said, “You work on one thing at a time so you can see the positive” He also said he was trying to remember, “United States”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;8:15 I called him, he asked “How was your night? What time did you get to bed?” We read the Day&amp;rsquo;s Text. And rehearsed the date, He got the 1st, and we practiced August a few more times. He said he was ready for therapy. And that he wishes he could do more on Saturday and Sunday. So we might do what a therapist suggested and navigate the hallways to the Main Lobby, gift shop, Atrium, garden, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;8:15 He said they had him in the shower already and everyone working with him was in a good mood. We read the Day&amp;rsquo;s Text, Rev 17:16 about the prostitute being burned with fire, he said, “Yikes.” 😄 We talked about yesterday&amp;rsquo;s morning worship on memory and how Jehovah miraculously activated Apostle John&amp;rsquo;s 90 year old mind to remember every word of Jesus prayer in John 17, from 60 years earlier. He said that was interesting and wanted to hear it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He asked how my drive home was last night. I said it was good, I got home at 9:00pm. He asked why so late. I told him that we said a prayer in the car as we got home. He said he was glad I was getting what I need. We read the Day&amp;rsquo;s Text and he said reminders about family can be such a big help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He rested well. When he gets words he doesn&amp;rsquo;t intend to, he realizes it&amp;rsquo;s not the one he wants and reattempts them 👏&#xA;For example, he said he will finish the speech therapy homework…. &amp;ldquo;This week, No, I mean Today”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He is using other really great transition phrases like:&#xA;The fact of the matter is&amp;hellip;&#xA;The long story short&amp;hellip;&#xA;The truth is&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He rested well. When I told him it is the 5th, he said “Yes and they are gonna start the big ones today.” He meant that more physical therapy was planned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He remembered that Jonathan the nurse is going on a cruise. And he remembered exactly which day he would leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;900-1200&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;9:00-12:00 &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#900-1200&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had 5 sessions and was resting at noon when I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He also said once he and I are back in Bethel together, that while he goes to Physical Therapy, I could go work at the office.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;900-1200&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;9:00-12:00 &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#900-1200&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four therapy sessions&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He asked what Leah and I will do today. He asked if after the CT scan on Friday, Leah and I will do something fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also he asked about the plan for the surgery. He said he hopes it can happen as soon as possible. We talked about preparing for the consultation with the neurosurgeon. He asked if I would be driving myself some days, because he&amp;rsquo;s concerned otherwise it will be a burden to Bethel transportation. I told him on Friday I will drive to Good Samaritan hospital for the CT scan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was feeling good and just had a visit from Dr. Seliger. He said the doctor explained the CT scan and the plan for surgery soon. Shane said he is looking forward  to getting the CT scan on Friday. A nurse will go with him at 7:00am. And Leah and I will drive there from Warwick to meet him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Leah and I went straight into Radiology and arrived just as they were checking Shane in. The Aide let me be with him for consent forms. They were very fast and took Shane back early. He stretched out on the CT bed. He held his head as he laid flat. And said it felt horrible. I got the impression he felt dizzy or pain from changing position. He said after 1-2 minutes he felt better. He was too far up on the CT bed, so they helped him reposition lower on the bed. The ceiling had two large flat screen TVs and they were playing a very peaceful ocean video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nick Shane&amp;rsquo;s roommate, went home in the morning and he sent us a message to say Hi to Shane and that he hopes to see us again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
