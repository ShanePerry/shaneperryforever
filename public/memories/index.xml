      <description>&lt;!-- Type the memory below. Keep the original wording whenever possible. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane and I had just gotten engaged at Gas Works Park in Seattle Washington after the Saturday program at the Tacoma District Convention. Afterwards, Dad and Mom invited us and Leah to dinner at IL Bistro in Pike Place Market.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shane said he was nervous to eat with his future Father-In-Law. When the waiter came, he ordered the cheapest thing on the menu because he didnt know Dad&amp;rsquo;s budget. He also secretly hoped it was big because he was hungry. Everyone else placed their orders and Dad ordered last. He got the rack of lamb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- Type the memory below. Keep the original wording whenever possible. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went with Shane to a convention when we were single serving in Brooklyn Bethel. I saw a girl I really wanted to talk to but I was intimidated. Shane said, “Dude, it’s not hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He walked up to her and started a conversation, then I joined, and he slowly backed out and left us talking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She and I are still married today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
