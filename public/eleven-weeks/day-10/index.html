He nodded his head when they asked if he was ok. They are using the ventilator while they transition him to sitting up. Also they turned it on in the early morning. He also started moving his right toes. Shane moved his right arm and his right toes.</p>
<h3 id="1100am" class="relative group">11:00am <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#1100am" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Brother Winder visited, Eric brought him. I took him back and Shane instantly recognized him although he had a mask on. Shane gave him a thumbs up. He said a prayer with us. Shane immediately closed his eyes. At the end, he couldn’t say Amen, so he gave thumbs up again. Brother Winder asked if we had been surprised at the response we had gotten as far as support and help. I said yes. He said it’s directly in proportion to how much this hurt Jehovah. His Spirit gets stirred and it moves people who are receptive to it to be supportive.</p>
<p>***Psalm 18:6-18
In my distress I called on Jehovah,
To my God I kept crying for help.
From his temple he heard my voice,
And my cry to him for help reached his ears.</p>
<p>7 Then the earth began to shake and rock;
The foundations of the mountains trembled
And shook back and forth because he had been angered.</p>
<p>8 Smoke ascended from his nostrils,
And a consuming fire came from his mouth;
Glowing coals blazed from him.</p>
<p>9 He made the heavens bend as he descended,
And thick gloom was beneath his feet.</p>
<p>10 He rode on a cherub and came flying.</p>
<p>13 Then Jehovah began to thunder in the heavens;
The Most High made his voice heard
He reached down from on high;
He took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters.***</p>
<p>He asked, “Have you felt like Jehovah has pulled you from deep waters?”</p>
<p>I said “Yes, I’ve had a calm feeling that is hard to put into words, even at times when I don’t think anyone could expect to be calm. And I feel like Jehovah has kept my mind from unraveling.”</p>
<p>He asked, &ldquo;Why is He helping you and Shane like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em><strong>Psalm 18:19
He rescued me because he was pleased with me.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Psalm 18:25
With someone loyal you act in loyalty.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="200pm" class="relative group">2:00pm <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#200pm" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Shane reached out his hand and spread his fingers. I put my hand in his. He squeezed it briefly and let it go. He spread out his hand again. I put mine in it again, but instead of squeezing it he turned his palm over to dump my hand out of his. I smiled and when he spread his palm out again, I told Betty to put her hand in his. He gripped her hand for a few minutes. It was his clear way of saying he realized his mom was there and that he appreciated her.</p>
<h3 id="500pm" class="relative group">5:00pm <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#500pm" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Gary and Christina Blackburn visited. Gary and I were standing on either side of Shane talking. We both saw him left his shoulders off the bed and point his left hand toward the trach. He couldnt reach the trach, but he got a hold of the towel the nurse rolled up to keep his head to one side. He dragged he towel out and laid it beside him. It took him so much effort to move like that. He leaned back and seemed exhausted. Gary and I wondered if what he was actually trying to remove was the trach. We told the nurse. The doctors decided to put a restraint on the left arm to prevent him from pulling the trach.</p>
