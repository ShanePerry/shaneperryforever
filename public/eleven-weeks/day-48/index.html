Chivonne told me it was in the WMC portal.</p>
<p>Kelsey the PA had said the pre-surgery CT was planned for Good Sam. But the WMC portal says it&rsquo;s scheduled with them. We&rsquo;ll take it!</p>
<p>After that scan, Shane&rsquo;s final surgery can be scheduled.</p>
<h2 id="1100" class="relative group">11:00 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#1100" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Our Bible student, Laura, and her three daughters went to the hospital. They waited outside because they didn&rsquo;t realize the visiting hours were limited from 12:00. She said she&rsquo;ll come back another day. 💜</p>
<h2 id="100" class="relative group">1:00 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#100" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The nurse, Jonathan, changed the bandages on his feet and where the peg tube was. It is all looking much better. Jonathan also was impressed that Shane remembered that he is planning a Caribbean cruise with his daughter.</p>
<h2 id="130-245" class="relative group">1:30-2:45 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#130-245" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>We watched the meeting. He was impressed that the speaker used a video experience on his talk. He didn&rsquo;t remember any talk outline that had videos, except the Special Talks or the ones by the CO. Ryan told him later that some updates outlines have videos with them.</p>
<h2 id="300" class="relative group">3:00 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#300" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Nathan and Chloe came. As they spoke Shane said seeing Nathan was bringing back his last visit. Chloe asked if it was when we watched the Celtics game 3. Shane said no, it was a memory of being in the office with him. It seemed like the memory was vivid and surprised even him. Nathan explained how his recovery from a broken leg went. And gave good tips on recovery and expectations. He also assured Shane to focus on that and not to worry about a change of assignment.</p>
<h2 id="400" class="relative group">4:00 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#400" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>He wanted to go downstairs. We coincided with
a quartet of live classical music in the Main Lobby. We explored more of the hospital because the rain storm kept us inside. He had more energy today because of not having any therapy.</p>
<h2 id="500" class="relative group">5:00 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#500" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Ryan and GC brought him a Celtics playoff championship shirt. He Loved it! He also got pizza.</p>
<h2 id="600" class="relative group">6:00 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#600" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Maribel brought me dinner and told us about her trip to Thailand. We did Bible reading together and she drove me home. Shane was concerned about her driving back to Haverstraw alone and suggested she stay the night with me at Warwick, to not drive home alone. Maribel said, next time when we can plan it.</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, if it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.</li>
<li>Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane&rsquo;s next surgery.</li>
<li>Please help us Thank Jehovah for the moments of joy and laughter!</li>
