The PT has requested a nap block and more rest in general so Shane can recharged for therapy. Visiting hours have been adjusted and wont conflict with that. And it already had a good effect on the afternoon sessions!!</p>
<p>2:30 PT
600 ft with the standard walker. The standard walker is actually too short for him and he ended up lifting it off the ground many times. Michael said that Laurell will order the proper size for him. All the same, Shane walked very quickly with the walker. The fastest I&rsquo;ve seen yet. Plus the nap helped. They also wrapped his right foot, while they wait for the orthotic.</p>
<p>Michael also saw Shane&rsquo;s energy level was good enough for descending and ascending the stairway! He went down and up a full flight of stairs with PT assist. 👏 His first stairway since the accident. The previous stairs were in the practice area in the gym. He did very well. And was not excessively tired from that session.</p>
<p>Michael said that he&rsquo;ll leave a note for Laurell, the primary PT, to train me to help with walking transfer to the restroom. For the meantime, I&rsquo;m trained for wheelchair transfer.</p>
<p>Shane noticed the structures of the sky lights at the top of the Atrium roof while he was walking through the hallways and asked what it was for. Michael explained the Atrium below and said that they could film the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible scene there if they wanted to. ☺️</p>
<p>After all the therapy he said he felt ok to go downstairs. He saw the main lobby, the Atrium, gift shop and the mural describing the history of the facility. He is really impressed by how nice the hospital is.</p>
<h2 id="345" class="relative group">3:45 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#345" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Karl the speech therapist gave his end of the week update and said he&rsquo;s impressed with his improvement on speech and memory this week. Karl says their conversations are very logical.</p>
<p>Marc &amp; Anita visited. Shane told them the surgery is coming in the next month. Anita asked if he wanted to choose a decoration for the skull prosthetic. He said, “We&rsquo;re gonna do a call about that“ ☺️ He&rsquo;s right, they did tell us we will do a pre-surgery consult!</p>
<p>He also told them that the friends from the infirmary came 2 days ago to see what he will need and plan for his transfer. That visit made him feel very good and confident that the day to progress from the hospital and back home is getting closer.</p>
<h2 id="545" class="relative group">5:45 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#545" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Josh and Gabrielle came. Shane actually in a moment of laughter said, “ah, nooooo Josh” He also called him a Bonehead. He wanted to rest so he asked to watch a movie all together. Later when we were alone, he said he really loves them.</p>
<h2 id="730" class="relative group">7:30 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#730" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Kati and Uros came and we did Bible Reading Psalm 70-71. And watched the last of the thunder and lightning storm and a rainbow. It felt like family worship.</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, if it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.</li>
<li>Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane&rsquo;s next surgery.</li>
<li>Please help us Thank Jehovah for the moments of joy and laughter!</li>

<p>(About infirmary personnel visit)
They came said we&rsquo;re gonna do the big one 2-3….how you say it. Let&rsquo;s say, not long ago. They came thru looked and planned something new</p>
<p>Me: It was so nice seeing Marc and Anita.
Shane: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re good girls, aren&rsquo;t they?”</p>
<p>Me: It was great being with Josh and Gabrielle
Shane: Yea he&rsquo;s a good kid</p>
