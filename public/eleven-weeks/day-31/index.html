        We had our first prayer together in 30 days! Shane prayed for us before dinner tonight. 🙏 It was so good!
Sofia Dominguez brought him Five Guys and the Giambras brought me chicken salad. He loved the burger and fries!
We told him that the previous evening, the nurse, Sastía, asked if we believe in Jesus and that we had a good conversation. He said, “That&rsquo;s good, We&rsquo;re close to the end.”

        <p>We had our first prayer together in 30 days! Shane prayed for us before dinner tonight. 🙏 It was so good!</p>
<p>Sofia Dominguez brought him Five Guys and the Giambras brought me chicken salad. He loved the burger and fries!</p>
<p>We told him that the previous evening, the nurse, Sastía, asked if we believe in Jesus and that we had a good conversation. He said, “That&rsquo;s good, We&rsquo;re close to the end.”</p>
<p>He got a photo frame from our friend Shawn and Tori. It can cycle through approx 1000 pictures. It sits on top of the tall dresser in his room below the tv. He really liked seeing pictures of our trip with Leah &amp; Sam.</p>
<p>Shane has started saying things that are very very him!</p>
<p>For example:
“Let&rsquo;s do it” instead of just ‘ok’
“I&rsquo;m wiped” instead of “I&rsquo;m tired”</p>
<p>Also
Sam said “You have cookie crumbs on your shirt”
Shane said “I like it that way”</p>
<p>Today the Case Manager, Lisa gave us an update. She is covering for John Matthews for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>She said he walked 50 feet ft with PT assisting him. This broke his previous record of 30 feet.</p>
<p>Also, as family, we can request to sit in for a PT session to see the progress too! I&rsquo;ll do that as soon as they let me.</p>
<p>The target discharge date is August 23.
Shane next asked about Goals for discharge. She said she would research it and get back to us.</p>
<p>He came back from the bathroom, noticed our tablet wasn&rsquo;t set up anymore and he asked, “what happened to it?” I had put it away while I had to be out of the room.</p>
<p>I was getting ready to go down the hall to the restroom and he asked me why, if his was closer.</p>
<p>He conversed a few more sentences in Spanish with Josue and Judy. He seemed comfortable to try with them because he could fall back to English whenever possible.</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, if it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.</li>
<li>Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future</li>
<li>Please help us Thank Jehovah for designing us so generously that we can recover even from accidents that He never meant to happen. Most inventors only invent to cover the need they see, but his designs are so adaptable that they can solve problems that were never meant to exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>More things though not in the shared notes

He said he thinks that his work will keep going.
Leah is feeling punky</p>
