        Shane got 3 hours of therapy today. Two hours in the morning. 1 hour in the afternoon.
He was good, calm &amp; tired but also the activity seemed to promote his staying awake and he asked many questions today.
The trach is capped again and they are in the capping process to prepare for removal. The cap makes it much easier for him to speak
👏 At one point he reached for my hand and said “Just talk to me.” ☺️

<p>The trach is capped again and they are in the capping process to prepare for removal. The cap makes it much easier for him to speak</p>
<p>👏 At one point he reached for my hand and said “Just talk to me.” ☺️</p>
<p>When he saw Alex Perez, something clicked and Shane spontaneously said</p>
<p>“By now probably all the tickets have been changed to someone else.”</p>
<p>No one had mentioned work tickets to him today, so that was completely from his own recollection. I was so excited.</p>
<p>He also asked many questions to Ken Tan when the subject turned to software design. Including asking about the Lennarts.</p>
<p>I showed him our 20th anniversary book, when I paused on a page he had already seen, he said “Keep going”</p>
<p>The nurses said they like Shane because he is very kind, he thanks them and says sorry if one of the monitors comes off.</p>
<p>Yesterday and today he expressed empathy to others.</p>
<p>For example, once he took my hand and said,
“Aww, you&rsquo;re cold.” He also said that when he saw me wearing my puffy vest.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday, he saw Bro Jadele&rsquo;s arm in a cast. He said, “Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry”</p>
<p>Also when Nori told him about her father being hospitalized, Shane said, “Oh no”</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns</p>
<p>Please help Shane have strength to do the therapy
Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future</p>
