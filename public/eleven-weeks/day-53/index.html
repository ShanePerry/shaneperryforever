<p>The nurse changed the bandage on his left foot. It is looking great, it has almost no lesion left, just redness. He doesn&rsquo;t complain about it at all. He only asks that the nurse take off the bandage fast. ☺️</p>
<p>Shane was wearing the brace when we came in to increase how long his skin can tolerate it. The nurse took it off so he could get comfortable for a nap.</p>
<h2 id="200" class="relative group">2:00 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#200" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>OT
PT
We put the brace back on. Shane navigated the chair out of the room. And realized he needed to disconnect the small air compressor at the foot of the bed to get around it. He fixed
that and left for OT.</p>
<p>PT
He tried out walking with a cane which was sized for him. He walked very steady and at almost his normal speed.</p>
<p>He practiced toe taps on the hurdles. She told him that he was circling his foot around the hurdle instead of going over it. So, he grinned and told her the hurdles weren&rsquo;t lined up. 😄</p>
<p>They steadied the hurdles as he tapped them. He said, “Look what you&rsquo;re doing…you&rsquo;re both helping me…now I just look terrible” 😅 It made them laugh.</p>
<h2 id="500" class="relative group">5:00 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#500" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>We finally got the TV connected to watch the iPad there. His favorites shows were the guy restoring a catamaran and the newborn calves on the farm show.</p>
<p>His roommate is preparing for discharge on Saturday.</p>
<h2 id="545" class="relative group">5:45 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#545" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>He got a haircut and a beard trim. The appointment with a stylist is provided by the hospital. It looks great. That tired him out.</p>
<h2 id="600" class="relative group">6:00 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#600" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Melissa &amp; Bo came. We explained that Bo and the other paramedics helped him when he had the accident. He said he had no idea and thanked him for his help.</p>
<h2 id="630" class="relative group">6:30 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#630" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The Chasulles came and he loved catching up with them. He asked how their sons are doing.</p>

And Kati brought him another coconut water, which he loves.</p>
<h2 id="750" class="relative group">7:50 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#750" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>He said he was extremely tired and asked us to let him sleep early. Tomorrow will be a big day. So Friday, he won&rsquo;t be able to have visitors.</p>
<p>Also, if everyone can help us…we won&rsquo;t do any drop-in visits for the next two weeks in preparation for the surgery. And we are reducing the visiting schedule even more. It&rsquo;s very hard to do that. But, they need us to keep his energy and immune system high, so he can be ready for the final surgery and the therapies. 👏</p>
<p>He does love getting voice messages though…so send any you want. Thank you!!</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, if it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.</li>
<li>Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane&rsquo;s next surgery.</li>
<li>Please help us Thank Jehovah</li>
