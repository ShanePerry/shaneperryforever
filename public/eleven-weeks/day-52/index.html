Also he asked about the plan for the surgery. He said he hopes it can happen as soon as possible. We talked about preparing for the consultation with the neurosurgeon. He asked if I would be driving myself some days, because he&rsquo;s concerned otherwise it will be a burden to Bethel transportation. I told him on Friday I will drive to Good Samaritan hospital for the CT scan.

She said they had their best conversation yet. And Shane explained that he and I had gone together to another country. She also said he wanted to be reminded about the plans for surgery and what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<h2 id="1230" class="relative group">12:30 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#1230" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Leah showed him the Dad Life video. He was smiling a lot and halfway through the video the nurse, Kristine, came in and said she was so happy to see his smile. He thanked her and told her that she works so hard. Then when that was done, he told Leah he wished he could watch the TV again&hellip;meaning he wanted to see the rest of the Dad Life video. ☺️</p>

That is dependent on the surgeon&rsquo;s schedule and insurance approval. He believes it is most likely that the surgery will happen by that time. Therefore, discharge to home on Aug 23, (which was our early estimate) is now unlikely.</p>
<p>What is most likely is surgery Aug 23 or sooner, then 4 days recovery in Westchester, next an undetermined rehab again in Helen Hayes, then discharge to Bethel.</p>
<p>If by some chance the surgery comes after August 23, the case manager said the most reasonable thing will be for Shane to stay in Helen Hayes while waiting for the surgery, and not to return home. But, he said that insurance will have a say in that scenario. Above all, the goal is for surgery on or before the 23rd.</p>
<p>I asked about the follow up with a cardiologist so they can continue the tests to find the original cause, the case manager says that the neurologist, Dr Seliger, will prepare those referrals as part of the discharge process.</p>

Laurell is extending the time with the brace. He&rsquo;s doing well with it. And he didn&rsquo;t want to move out of the chair to the bed afterwards. His energy was still good.</p>

They hugged and Shane really enjoyed catching up. He asked about Karen&rsquo;s foot and what has been going on with them and the office. Jeff told him they are waiting for him at home and his home in Warwick. For the first time since Shane has been aware of the situation, he didn&rsquo;t disagree about that or express concern on whether that could be true.</p>
<p>As Jeff and I went downstairs, we crossed paths with Dr. Seliger. We asked about the cranioplasty and the materials used for the prosthetic. He said they have used a carbon based material for 30 years. It has excellent success. The natural bone can have some infection risks, but the carbon based material does not. And there is no elevated risk for cancer. Although brain trauma itself can have a slightly higher risk for cancer. Leah and I had prayed specifically about this in the morning. This answer was good. Dr Seliger has seen thousands of patients. Shane and I will also get input during the consultation with the neurosurgery team.</p>
<h2 id="330" class="relative group">3:30 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#330" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Karen and I went upstairs and Shane met us in the hallway. He asked if we could go somewhere to visit outside of the room. We sat in the dining room. She brought laminated cards of the shepherd and the lamb from the Return to Jehovah brochure. She told us both we are that lamb in Jehovah&rsquo;s arms. And there&rsquo;s no problem that His large capable hands can&rsquo;t solve. Shane appreciated hearing that not only is he loved at home, he is Liked too. He protested only once, but Karen is irresistible so he gave in. 😊</p>

They showed a picture of the visitor center and the actors from the village greeting the delegates. Shane remembered that the Philadelphia special convention was last weekend. And asked how it was all going.</p>
<h2 id="630" class="relative group">6:30 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#630" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Osvaldo and Sheila came by.
