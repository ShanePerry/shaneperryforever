        8:00 we talked on the phone. He asked how my night was and asked about my Dad.
He says, Papa &amp; Mama
12:00 had lunch and we met Barbara a nurse from another floor who goes to the Stony Point congregation. 👏
He said our prayers before both meals today and said “Thank you for our nice family. Please keep them safe.”
1:00pm we watched the meeting together 🙏 he had to rest his eyes a while, but he asked me to keep it on and turn the volume up. One time I got up to put away the clean laundry and asked me why I wasnt sitting and I should just set and enjoy it. 😅👏

        <p>8:00 we talked on the phone. He asked how my night was and asked about my Dad.
He says, Papa &amp; Mama</p>
<p>12:00 had lunch and we met Barbara a nurse from another floor who goes to the Stony Point congregation. 👏</p>
<p>He said our prayers before both meals today and said “Thank you for our nice family. Please keep them safe.”</p>
<p>1:00pm we watched the meeting together 🙏 he had to rest his eyes a while, but he asked me to keep it on and turn the volume up. One time I got up to put away the clean laundry and asked me why I wasnt sitting and I should just set and enjoy it. 😅👏</p>
<p>2:00pm He visited with Mario and Gismell Vargas. He had a long conversation in Spanish about Mario&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>When he visited with the Vargas family…he wanted to keep conversation going and said
“Vanessa what else do we need to know?”</p>
<p>He got Five Guys and tacos and refrescos thanks to the congregation in Haverstraw.</p>
<p>He loves visits from young people and seems very entertained listening to the things they say.</p>
<p>We kept watching the meeting afterwards. He asked me to get “three of those things and flop them over the ???”….and pointed to toward the window. I went to close the blind and he said, “No, that&rsquo;s not it. Take all three of those and just flip them over. I can see them right there.” he pointed again toward the window sill. It took me a minute then I realized he wanted the extra three pillows spread out over the vent of the air conditioner, so it wouldn&rsquo;t blast so much cold air. 👏😅 He said I got it right.</p>
<p>His long and short term memory is improving daily.</p>
<p>As I took the dinner food tray out of the room, he told me not to forget the plate cover. He pointed to where I had set it down on the windowsill. He remembered I put it there, even though I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Also, Betty went home today. But I hadn&rsquo;t mentioned it yet. She had told him the night before. So at a certain moment today I said, “I&rsquo;m so grateful to your mama.” He said, “Yes, she should be home soon.”</p>
<p>For long term memory,
We looked at pictures of 2008-2012 in Nicaragua. He said he remembered many parts of  it 🤗</p>
<p>Eric told us a nice experience yesterday. He said the Tuesday after Shane&rsquo;s fall, Eric had gone down to the dining room and Bro. Sanderson to give him a big hug. He said, “Don&rsquo;t lose hope, I&rsquo;ve seen things like these and worse and I&rsquo;ve seen people who make a remarkable recovery.” 🥹</p>
<p>Also Ceci told me that Brother Jackson recently said, “We heard the good report about Shane. That&rsquo;s Jehovah&rsquo;s miracle. Tell Shane and Vanessa we are praying for them.”</p>
<p>A few other excellent things he does now are,
in the bed he reaches up and pulls himself upward in the bed, to get into a better position.</p>
<p>Also, in the hallway, when I push him in the wheelchair, he points which direction we should go. He&rsquo;s always been good about directions.
It&rsquo;s good to see it coming back.</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. We have been praying these consistently. So maybe we can also ask Him to make it clear if he has answered this prayer. 💓</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, if it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.</li>
<li>Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future</li>
<li>Please help us Thank Jehovah!!</li>
</ol>
<p>He pointed to the picture of the Port-o-John in Nicaragua Lago Apanas and said, “hehe, pee”</p>
