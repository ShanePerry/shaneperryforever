We read the Day’s Text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The wild beast that <em>was</em> but <em>is not</em> . . . goes off into destruction.” — Rev. 17:11</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This wild beast looks almost the same as the seven‑headed wild beast, except that it is scarlet-colored. It is called “the image of the wild beast” and is described as “an eighth king.” (Rev. 13:14, 15; 17:3, 8)</p>
<p>This “king” is spoken of as coming into existence, then going out of existence, and later reappearing. This fits the United Nations very well: first as the League of Nations, then going out of existence during World War II, and then re‑emerging in its present form.</p>
<p>By means of propaganda, the political beasts stir up opposition to Jehovah and his people, symbolically gathering “the kings of the entire inhabited earth” to Armageddon.<br>
<em>—w22.05 10 ¶10–11</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>We also read Cindy’s message, which touched both of us deeply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>**“Dear ones… we got home at 5 am and I’m trying to put my life together and it made me think of you two!<br>
What a marvel it has been reading your texts every day.<br>
You taught us well by real life and seeing Jehovah’s blessings.<br>
You and Shane encouraged us so much by how you faced your challenges.<br>
Just beautiful.</p>
<p>I’m glad you will finally return to some normal.<br>
You’re even showing much wisdom in how you will be doing that!<br>
Truly proof Jehovah is with you both. 💗</p>
<p>Going home tomorrow — wow.<br>
What a stretch it has been, but what miracles you have experienced.</p>
<p>Shane and you will be able to sit down with Job and his wife and cross notes.</p>
<p>We love you both.<br>
May your day coming home have Jehovah’s spirit and the true joy that comes with it.</p>
<p>Our warmest love,<br>
Bob and Cindy.”**</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="920-am" class="relative group">9:20 AM <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#920-am" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Called Shane. We were getting ready to leave in the Bethel van. We were packed and going to pick up his prescriptions — insurance paid for them.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That’s great, Cheekies. You know what? I’ve been thinking. I can beat this. It’s not gonna be easy and I’ll have to think really hard, but I <em>can</em> beat this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shane was cheerful and positive.<br>
He was excited to come home, and he even said he was sure he could beat this.</p>
<p>That gives me so much comfort — knowing his thoughts were happy and not discouraged.<br>
He knew this:</p>
<ul>
<li>he is loved</li>
<li>he is wanted</li>
<li>and Bethel is his home to come back to</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="955-am" class="relative group">9:55 AM <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#955-am" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>We were five minutes from Helen Hayes hospital. Dr. Selliger called me in van. He said Shane had some kind of event. And the paramedics were working on him.</p>
<p>We arrived. The ambulance was waiting at the back doors of the hospital. The staff reached out to put their hands on us as we went up the Unit 3A.</p>
<p>The nurses were gathered around the video monitor of Shane&rsquo;s room. We nodded and thanked them. I, Jeremy and Dakota walked into the entry of the room. Shane was lying on the floor, three doctors, the physician&rsquo;s assistant Kelsey and 2 paramedics were with him. They were doing cycles of CPR. Dr. Selliger and Kelsey walked us backwards out to the hallway. An aide brought a chair for me. Dr. Selliger said they had observed some kind of event, he said it had the appearance of a seizure, but he wasn&rsquo;t convinced that was what it was. I asked if his heart was stopped. He said yes, he was currently in cardiac arrest. The lead paramedic stepped out and said he didnt recommend that family stay in the room while they did their ressusitation attempts. He walked us to the family waiting area.</p>
<p>Jeremy and Dakota said prayers out loud.</p>
<p>10 minutes later Dr. Hall came in, he said they were in the 3rd ressusitation cycle. He said if they are able to get a stable heart rhythm they would transfer him to Good Samaritan. I asked him what they would do for him there. He said a cardiologist would oversee the care there. I asked if Shane&rsquo;s heart rhythm had changed since we saw him. He said no. I showed him Shane&rsquo;s medical directive and said, &ldquo;I know you have a copy of this. It&rsquo;s Shane&rsquo;s end-of-life wishes. Shane&rsquo;s desire is not to be left in a state that is hopeless or dependant long term on life support. I am prepared to honor his wishes. What I dont know is if we are at that point yet. That is the information I need from you, his doctors.&rdquo; Dr. Hall said, he would go to get that answer for us. 10 minutes later Dr. Hall, Dr. Selliger and the doctor in charge of the ressusitation efforts came to say after the 4th ressusitation attempt, Shane had no heart rhythm and they called the code.</p>
<p>They said he was not conscious after the initial event. He didn’t have pain or anxiety. He’s resting now and nothing can hurt him.</p>
<p>That gives me relief.</p>
<p><strong>Satan couldn’t take him from Jehovah.<br>
Shane won.</strong></p>
<p>His life is far from over.<br>
We can start planning the welcome‑back party.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1100-am" class="relative group">11:00 AM <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#1100-am" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>After the two other doctors left, Dr. Hall stayed (he is the one who said he likes volunteer work).
He said it is remarkable that someone ask young as Shane had prepared written instructions. He said that people in that hospital who are twice Shane&rsquo;s age were still pretending like this day would never come. He said he could see how it helped me as his wife to be confident of what Shane would want. He asked what made him do that. I said it&rsquo;s because Shane is one of Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses and cherished life. He wanted to care for his life in the best way possible and he wanted to prepare me any way he could to do that difficult steps. So that I wasnt making the decision alone, I was simply honoring the choices Shane had already made.</p>
<p>Then two physicians assistants came in.</p>
<p>One was Kelsey Pellicone, his PA. I told Kelsey that everything she did was right, and that Shane had faith in Jehovah — and that Jehovah can fix this in the new world.</p>
<p>The other PA was Sweetie St. John. She asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are you one of JW?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I said &ldquo;Yes, we both are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What Kingdom Hall do you go to?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I said <strong>Pomona Route 202</strong>.</p>
<p>She asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do you know Dr. Howard? She is my best friend. She tells me about Jehovah, and I get so mad at her because she tells me what Jehovah will want me to do. But she is my best friend because she tells me what is right and what is wrong.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the most brutal day of my life, and at the same time Jehovah&rsquo;s name was honored and respected precisely because of those painful events. It made a lasting impression on the people who observed Shane, his faith still speaks, like Abel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By faith Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than that of Cain,d and through that faith he received the witness that he was righteous, for God approved his gifts, and although he died, <em><strong>he still speaks through his faith</strong></em>.&rdquo;
-Hebrews 4:11</p>
