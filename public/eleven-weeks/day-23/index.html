        Our best day yet.
Shane moved to Helen Hayes rehab today. They had given the idea that it would be Wednesday, but then at 11:30 they gave us the good news that it was all approved.
3:00pm the ambulance came.
It was a good trip. Both the paramedics took JW.ORG contact cards. The young woman said she just started reading the Bible in Genesis. And took our contact info.
Shane could speak more and asked many more questions. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the swallow test and speaking valve.

        <p>Our best day yet.</p>
<p>Shane moved to Helen Hayes rehab today. They had given the idea that it would be Wednesday, but then at 11:30 they gave us the good news that it was all approved.
3:00pm the ambulance came.</p>
<p>It was a good trip. Both the paramedics took JW.ORG contact cards. The young woman said she just started reading the Bible in Genesis. And took our contact info.</p>
<p>Shane could speak more and asked many more questions. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the swallow test and speaking valve.</p>
<p>The facility is very large and quiet. Not over crowded. The staff seems calm, firm and not overwhelmed. He was much calmer today.</p>
<p>They got him a bigger bed, immediately when they were settling him in. His feet don&rsquo;t hit the footboard anymore.</p>
<p>He apologized to the nurses for “not being 100% yet” They told him not to worry.</p>
<p>He skipped ads on the YouTube channel he was watching.</p>
<p>We did Bible reading and watch broadcast.</p>
<p>He gave me a kiss goodnight and when Josh teased him and asked for one, he just blew a kiss in the air.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning they&rsquo;ll start the activities. Visiting hours are 12-8pm.</p>
<p>We both feel relieved having made this milestone.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to help us pray for something, it&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>Help Shane to feel comfortable and adapt quickly to the new facility
A prayer of thanks 🙏</p>
<p>Empathy
