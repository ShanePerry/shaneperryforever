        8:30 I called him. He asked me how my night was. He said he was pretty sure therapy was going to start soon. According to the schedule I saw later, it was Speech Therapy with Karl. Before we hung up, we rehearsed the date, July 30. He did great with July. Every night, we mark the days off a large print calendar that I got on Amazon and hung beside the bed. That has helped him remember the month, July.

He said he didn&rsquo;t know and that he felt sad about that. He shared an excellent gem about not completely knowing the precise reason that Jehovah loves us, which means we don&rsquo;t have to feel worthy or unworthy, we can just bask in the fact that he loves us.</p>
<p>We got some good updates from the staff below. Being there every day helps. It makes more frequent updates possible.</p>
<p>3:45pm
Laurel Physical Therapy
The orthotic to train the right forefoot to lift should should arrive Friday
Laurel trained and cleared me to help him get to the restroom using the wheelchair transfer. Which means now we don&rsquo;t have to wait for a nurse to come to help him get to the bathroom. I can do it.
My next training will be how to assist him while he is walking. Then I will apply for a job so I can get there at 7:30am when all the day nurses do. 😅</p>
<p>3:50pm
Kelsey Pellicone PA
Peg tube should come out tomorrow
CT with stealth protocol still ordered for Good Sam, date still to-be-determined
Cranioplasty date still to-be-determined
Most likely after 4 days recovery from the cranioplasty in Westchester, he will come back to Helen Hayes as in-patient for an undetermined period of time.
She will request iron, B-12 (and epo if his blood level warrants it) in preparation for the surgery
Dr. Wainwright, neurosurgeon, can consult for questions about surgery &amp; materials used.</p>
<p>4:00 Shane got a new neighbor sharing the room…Shane listened to all the questions the Dr. asked during the young man&rsquo;s assessment. If Shane memorizes right answers…he&rsquo;ll be out of there in no time! ☺️ The man seems quiet and recovering well from an accident.
Shane reached for the ear plugs and got a nap even though the nurses were working settling the other man in.</p>
<p>4:30 Ryan Lewis came. Shane was surprised about the surgery Ryan had and him coming in on a scooter to rest his foot. Ryan talked about not being able to do the Chairman at the meeting because of it. And Shane said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ok, we have plenty of brothers.” The reminisced about an elders meeting in 2019. Shane looked at the photo that Ryan had printed for him and he said he remembered that day.</p>
<p>7:40 two Indian women came and visited Shane. They were in the Family waiting area of the Westchester ICU with us for two weeks. Their brother reached out to me first while we were there because he noticed all our visitors were Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses. He said he loves near the Cherry Lane Kingdom Hall and says he like JW. They go to his mechanic shop. Sadly, their mother who was in ICU passed away, during the time we were together in  But I got their phone number before they left Westchester. We have stayed in touch. Today they came to see Shane!!! 😍 He asked them to remind him how they met. They said they never met him. And explained about their mother. Shane said he was sorry and that he was so pleased that someone who he never met would care that much about him. They said they believe God did a miracle for him. We got to share the resurrection hope with the two fleshly sisters. Jehovah&rsquo;s name is praised in unique ways, that can only happen BECAUSE of this circumstance.</p>
<p>Many other excellent visits and conversations today. His progress makes me feel like I&rsquo;m witnessing a slow motion resurrection. And my confidence in His healing power in the New World is through the roof. If He can accomplish such remarkable things even in the midst of Satan&rsquo;s failed rule, imagine what He will do when Jesus rules.</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. We have been praying these consistently. So maybe we can also ask Him to make it clear if he has answered this prayer. 💓</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, if it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.</li>
<li>Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future</li>
<li>Please help us Thank Jehovah!!</li>
