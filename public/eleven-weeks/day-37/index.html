        Another good day.
We got to watch Shane as he worked out both legs on the step. He was very steady.
Shane is doing well with the therapy routine. Today when the physical therapist came, he said “Let&rsquo;s do it!”
Later he told us, “I&rsquo;m not at my full potential. It&rsquo;s coming…just slowly.”
We had a great day with Betty and delicious meals from friends 💙
He didn&rsquo;t have much strength for visits and asked that we just let him sleep a few times although he said, “You can keep talking.”

        <p>Another good day.</p>
<p>We got to watch Shane as he worked out both legs on the step. He was very steady.</p>
<p>Shane is doing well with the therapy routine. Today when the physical therapist came, he said “Let&rsquo;s do it!”</p>
<p>Later he told us, “I&rsquo;m not at my full potential. It&rsquo;s coming…just slowly.”</p>
<p>We had a great day with Betty and delicious meals from friends 💙</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have much strength for visits and asked that we just let him sleep a few times although he said, “You can keep talking.”</p>
<p>The nurse said his right ear drum has healed. They will check hearing in the future.</p>
<p>Also now that the left eye is opening more, we will ask that they check vision.</p>
<p>He moved into room 9b. He has a million dollar view of the Hudson. His bed is by the window. He can watch the sailboats from the bed. 👏</p>
<p>He shares the room with a gentleman named Patrick and of all the coincidences his wife, Sara, is a sister in Spring Valley. 😅🎉 He told us he had a stroke last month. But he is doing so well and will likely be discharged on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick was distressed for about 15 minutes because he only saw his phone and he thought he lost his wallet. Shane reassured him multiple times, saying it would turn up eventually.  And in time he realized that his wife had kept it at home, to keep it safe.</p>
<p>This evening, the nurse, Sastía, asked if I was a religious minister and if I could help a gentleman who was having suicidal thoughts.
She said she knew we were with the Watchtower. Since the hospital doesn&rsquo;t have any minister on site, she wondered if I could help.</p>
<p>I said I am a Bible reader, give classes and would go. Although I haven&rsquo;t helped someone in that situation. But I also told her our friend who is an elder and was waiting in the lobby. She asked if I could get him.</p>
<p>She went to tell the patient, then she returned and said they are getting the psychologist. The gentleman said he changed his mind and that he wasn&rsquo;t ready for a visit at the moment. So they requested the psychologist instead. We made him a card out of the poster boards and the nurse said he really liked it. She said brain injuries can have difficult phases, especially as they first arrive. I told her that was the greatest compliment she could give me that she thought of me to help in that moment.</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. We have been praying these consistently. So maybe we can also ask Him to make it clear if he has answered this prayer. 💓</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, if it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.</li>
<li>Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future</li>
<li>Please help us Thank Jehovah!!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that both eyes open more, he told us that
If I close my left eye, I can see well, if I close my right eye, I can see well. But it I open the both…it&rsquo;s blurry.</p>
<p>Reporting early 😉</p>
