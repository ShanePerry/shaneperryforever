        <h3 id="700am" class="relative group">7:00am <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#700am" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The trach &amp; peg surgeries were started and finished before I arrived.</p>
<h3 id="900am" class="relative group">9:00am <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#900am" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The surgeries were a success. Shane was off of the breathing tubes and O2 was supplied via the tube in his throat. All feeding would be via the peg directly into his stomach instead of the other set of tubes passing down his throat. He was sleeping, but he looked much more relaxed than we’d seen him yet and his face began showing more of his natural expressions.</p>
<h3 id="1200pm" class="relative group">12:00pm <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#1200pm" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Shane squeezed my hand for long periods of time. He opened his eyes again and again. He was awake for short bursts. As he looked around I explained that this was West Chester hospital and that he had an accident, but that he was getting better. I also told him that the Celtics won the playoffs. I didn’t see quite the reaction I expected, so I figured I’d keep telling him each day until it sunk in. He seemed sleepier during that day than the day before. He had another good test without the ventilator but he did seem more tired because he was doing the breathing on his own. They said after a few more successful breathing tests, they could fit him for a helmet and he can be moved out of the bed to a recliner, which will help him avoid pressure injuries.</p>
<h3 id="500pm" class="relative group">5:00pm <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#500pm" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Betty decided she would stay until Saturday. Bill was doing well with the caregiver and Kevin’s help. Betty was an unbelievable support for me. She had many years of experience as a nurse and was quick to notice and point out any positive improvements. She wasn’t overly emotional, just practical and matter-of-fact. She also made me feel like she trusted my decisions. That meant so much to me because I was not used to making the decisions on my own, especially very serious ones. I was far more comfortable being on a team with Shane as the head. He was easy to follow and easy to please. So feeling like I was at the helm of the ship was unsettling. But Jehovah filled the missing pieces in. He gave me a calm mind with clear thoughts. Also, whenever there was a choice for me to make, I asked him to make me feel an unbreakable calm if we had arrived at a reasonable decision. That unmistakable peace helped me know when He had responded. I steered the ship, with his help.</p>
