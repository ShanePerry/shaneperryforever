The airbnb and the car rental didn’t work out well. We asked if there was any chance for last minute accommodation. Josh and Justin got it worked out.</p>
<h3 id="200-pm" class="relative group">2:00 PM <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#200-pm" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Cecibel Loff and I did a massage for Shane. When we took off his left sock we could see a pressure wound had formed on the outside and sole of his left foot. It was a large blister. Wound care came and dressed it. But his feet kept hitting the foot of the bed and eventually the blister opened. They had already extended the foot of the bed to the maximum. And they had even looked into getting a longer bed, but the ICU room would not fit a larger bed.</p>
<h3 id="345-pm" class="relative group">3:45 PM <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#345-pm" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Spont test started. The respiratory tech, Megan Gonzalez recognized Shane’s medical directive bracelet and told us she was a Witness too in the White Plains congregation. Her comments about Shane’s progress were very reassuring. She said when patients made the rapid progress that he was making, it was a very good sign that they would make a solid recovery. She had a goal for commuting so I put her in touch with other sisters in my congregation who were doing the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="900-pm" class="relative group">9:00 PM <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#900-pm" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>I was saying goodnight and emotion got the better of me and I started to cry out loud. I had tried not to be emotional in Shane’s presence because I didn’t want it to distress or confuse him that he was doing worse. Because he was improving rapidly. I wanted him to sense me staying calm and upbeat, so that he would know I believed that he could recover. But as I cried, I made a sound and it seemed like he turned his head slowly in my direction, to the left. Then I had an even stronger sense that he was listening although his eyes were still closed. I walked to the opposite side of the bed, got close to his ear and said “Shane, open your eyes, Shane open your eyes.” I used a nervous tone as if I needed his help. He turned his head to the right, in my direction. I saw his left eyelid lift slowly and drop back down as if it weighed 100 pounds. I got so excited I was shaking. I didn’t think any nurse would believe what I saw. I got my phone out. Videos and pictures were not allowed. But I took it anyway. He opened his eyes two more times at my request. I was ecstatic. It was the first time I saw his blue eyes look at me in 5 days. The nurse heard me talking animatedly to him and she came in and kindly but firmly said to delete the video. I deleted it and said goodnight. I walked back toward the waiting room and undid the delete. Zack and Katie were waiting to drive me home. And Eric and Cecibel Loff were still there too. I almost couldn’t get the words out, “Shane just opened his eyes!” They all stood up and hugged me. I felt a rush of happiness.</p>
<h3 id="1000-pm" class="relative group">10:00 PM <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#1000-pm" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Andrea and Francesca Re and Rebecca were waiting for me at the B-residence side walk. I opened the car door excitedly and told them the news that Shane opened his eyes. It was a great night.</p>
