        A great day!
Shane had 1.5 planned hours of OT. Sunday schedule is lighter. But after that Chivonne and I got to take him OUTSIDE!
When we were outside, I asked to hold his hand…he said, “because you are nervous”
😅 He&rsquo;s right, I was. It was just first time going out for 28 days. But everything went really well.
It was really great. The fresh air and sunlight were so relaxing. He finally got to see a little more of the hospital. He also could hear the live music artist in the main lobby.

        <p>A great day!</p>
<p>Shane had 1.5 planned hours of OT. Sunday schedule is lighter. But after that Chivonne and I got to take him OUTSIDE!</p>
<p>When we were outside, I asked to hold his hand…he said, “because you are nervous”
😅 He&rsquo;s right, I was. It was just first time going out for 28 days. But everything went really well.</p>
<p>It was really great. The fresh air and sunlight were so relaxing. He finally got to see a little more of the hospital. He also could hear the live music artist in the main lobby.</p>
<p>Chivonne told him he has a nice beard
He touched it and said, “I haven&rsquo;t cut this in so long”</p>
<p>Also when someone asked about his recovery, he said.
“The new system will come and it will be better
But it hasn&rsquo;t come yet.”
We made sure he knew that the doctors said he will be able to recover very much even now.</p>
<p>What he mentioned the paradise, I was glowing. He&rsquo;s remembering more clearly things about himself.</p>
<p>The guys from Haverstraw came and planned what fast food they are gonna bring him, when he gets approved for outside food. Chick-fil-A, Five Guys seemed to get the biggest nod.</p>
<p>Our Bible student Laura came to visit. She cut flowers from her garden and read him a whole chapter of the Bible. Hebrews 11. Her choice. She read in Spanish and he responded a few times in Spanish.</p>
<p>He liked hearing the day text and watched a bit of the “Commit Your Way” drama</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, if it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.</li>
<li>Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future</li>
<li>Please help us Thank Jehovah for his gift of repair and reconstruction</li>
