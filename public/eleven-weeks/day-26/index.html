        Shane got 3.5 hours of therapy today.
He transferred to the chair. Sam and I played a card game with him. We played War and he took every trick but the last. We tied and then I had the last high card. 💗
He also went to the PT room and then went to a hallway where they practiced standing and sitting and taking steps. He did great. And insisted that he lift himself by pushing off the armrests of the chair.

        <p>Shane got 3.5 hours of therapy today.</p>
<p>He transferred to the chair. Sam and I played a card game with him. We played War and he took every trick but the last. We tied and then I had the last high card. 💗</p>
<p>He also went to the PT room and then went to a hallway where they practiced standing and sitting and taking steps. He did great. And insisted that he lift himself by pushing off the armrests of the chair.</p>
<p>He also asked them a ton of questions about how long they would work with him. And if they had done it before.</p>
<p>He slept very soundly in between sessions. And when he woke up, he was more alert than I&rsquo;d seen yet.</p>
<p>They removed the trach. He seems so relieved. It&rsquo;s bandaged and we can hear his voice clearly.</p>
<p>He got upgraded to normal food. Dinner was the first meal. Fish, mashed potatoes and gravy, beets, apple juice, milk, yogurt and fruit juice. He said it tasted good.</p>
<p>At that moment Gary and Christia Blackburn were there. And he asked if we had come just to watch him eat. 😅</p>
<p>He also had dozens of questions, including how long things were going to last. Also about what Gary and Christia had done for work that day. He asked about getting a cabin. We believe that means a Wallkill cabin. Because Gary had told him about a possible camping trip in the fall. He asked question after question and laughed really hard a few times. Including when Gary put the helmet on.</p>
<p>He asked why he was there. We got to explain what happened. He said he didn&rsquo;t remember any of that.</p>
<p>After we mentioned him falling outside the office, then he asked for Jeremy by name about four times on different occasions. ☺️</p>
<p>He asked for us to sit down, I think he was enjoying the company and didn&rsquo;t want it to end.</p>
<p>We read him his poster board. He likes it including the Chick-fil-A logo we drew him.</p>
<p>Leah and I played him music and then the Daniel drama and later Sam finished watching it with him, while I had dinner downstairs. They said a prayer together. Then I came back up. We did Bible reading and he was Out!</p>
<p>The care manager said the doctors plan to request 6 weeks of rehab. They will request it from insurance one week at a time. They said this is all normal.</p>
<p>This really was the best day yet. His questions
were great. He&rsquo;s hungry for more input!</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns</p>
<ol>
<li>Please help Shane have strength to do the therapy</li>
<li>Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future</li>
