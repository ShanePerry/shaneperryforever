        Even better than yesterday.
Shane got good rest today. Watched the July Broadcast, a few shows he likes and got to hear about Ramapo from Solon. He really seemed to be interested in that. When Solon&rsquo;s iPad buffered during a video…Shane reached up and swiped it, to move on to the next picture. ☺️
No physical therapy today, but he made the most of the extra rest
Speech therapy came for the speaking valve and swallowing test but he was sleeping so decided to do the test tomorrow morning after a night&rsquo;s sleep.

<p>Speech therapy came for the speaking valve and swallowing test but he was sleeping so decided to do the test tomorrow morning after a night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Surgeons visited with only positive comments.</p>
<p>He says thank you to the nurses when they take care of something for him. He felt very calm today. Was more comfortable with the trach and O2 tube.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s hardly anything to report for vitals, all good 👍</p>
<p>He reached up and put a hand on my shoulder.
And seemed to blow me a kiss when I was across the room.</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray, these are the top three</p>
<p>That rehab plans continue smoothly
That Shane and I feel calm and peaceful into this next phase
A prayer of THANKS to the master of reconstruction! I&rsquo;m in awe as I watch these incredible designs obey their designer 🙏</p>
