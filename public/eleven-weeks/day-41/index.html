        Shane had a great day. No scheduled therapy so he had a great nap in the morning &amp; early afternoon and some visits in the late afternoon/evening.
Kristine the RN talked about Shanes upcoming CT scan at Good Samaritan. She said they usually send patients for CT scan in the stretcher so that they don&rsquo;t wait as long at the hospital. If they send the patient in a wheelchair, the patient waits longer.

        <p>Shane had a great day. No scheduled therapy so he had a great nap in the morning &amp; early afternoon and some visits in the late afternoon/evening.</p>
<p>Kristine the RN talked about Shanes upcoming CT scan at Good Samaritan. She said they usually send patients for CT scan in the stretcher so that they don&rsquo;t wait as long at the hospital. If they send the patient in a wheelchair, the patient waits longer.</p>
<p>They started using Therapeutic Honey to heal the wounds on his feet. The wounds are looking much better.</p>
<p>The Trach wound is good. The RN said after a day or two she should be able to leave it uncovered.</p>
<p>Peg feeding tube will come out this coming week.</p>
<p>Two nursing students helped Shane this morning, under guidance of his RN. He said they can work with him again tomorrow.</p>
<p>He got to visit with Jim &amp; Ruth Stewart who were visiting from VA. He seemed to really enjoy those conversations and an update about the Hearing Aid arrangement.</p>
<p>Shane-You got to hang with everyone over there and see what they do? (At the office)
Jim-No not this trip. It was just a quick visit. Marc is awesome he&rsquo;s holding down the fort
S-I love him. I&rsquo;ve known him for less than 8 years. But he&rsquo;s new and the best. There&rsquo;s gotta be a way to do all of it, and Global can step back. You just gotta find it.
J-We got some new people. Zach Ebo, who worked with a hearing aid company. And new sisters just to handle the back end.
S-Are they doing the overnight stuff.
J-Not the fittings in the middle of the night. But Bethelites are off and the new sisters are familiar with HuB.
S-Good they just needed one new…help me babe, what&rsquo;s it called when there is one way that they all walk together…
V-Workflow?
S-Yes they needed the workflow
J-The hard part was the HuB training. But we passed that. And now we&rsquo;ve trimmed down the attachments and simplified things.
S-Yes, the first new people would have recognized the difference.
J-Yes it&rsquo;s way better
S-Its because Jehovah wants people like that
J- And he wants people taken care of. It&rsquo;s his Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Ruth-You both are a good team
Vanessa-Yep we know a good thing. Twenty years and we&rsquo;re gonna stay together.
Shane-Maybe *he raised one eyebrow and grinned</p>
<p>I told him Eric was coming, he asked, “From JHC…O?” I said, “Yes GHCO”</p>
<p>He got to tell Eric his concern that we wouldn&rsquo;t get to stay at Bethel. Eric said, “They aren&rsquo;t worried about that right now. And what you have to focus on is getting better” Eric compared the process to what Jehovah will do during the resurrection. It&rsquo;s as if Jehovah has all the memories stored with him, in the cloud 😊 and Jehovah can download them to the resurrected one, whenever necessary. And in Shane&rsquo;s case, the memories are still stored in his brain. It will just take a little time to remake the millions of connections. Shane said “I hope so” 💙</p>
<p>He also saw his Bible student, Jeremy. He was so happy to hear that Jeremy is still studying and he got a summer job at the school. Jeremy drew him a chocolate donut with frosting and sprinkles on the poster board because Shane always brings them both one before his Bible study.</p>
<p>We also got to catch up with Chris (HLC) and Avonda Fairley. They told us such encouraging things. She compared memory repair to a device when it has to retrieve a photo or file that hasnt been used in a while and it takes time to load again before you can see it.</p>
<p>Chris said they made a presentation at Westchester medical center about bloodless medicine and he used Shane&rsquo;s example as part of the introduction. He said it caught the attention of some skilled nurses and social workers. They had many questions at the end, and they were impressed by the support we have via Jehovah&rsquo;s organization. Including the service group overseer arrangement.</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. We have been praying these consistently. So maybe we can also ask Him to make it clear if he has answered this prayer. 💓</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, if it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.</li>
<li>Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future</li>
<li>Please help us Thank Jehovah!!</li>
