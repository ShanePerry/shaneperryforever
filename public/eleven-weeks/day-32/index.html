        Another good day!
I called Shane at 8:30am.
He remembered me leaving last night. He asked if the same couple would bring me back today. He asked if Leah is getting better.
His short term memory is at hard at work.
🤗🤗
We looked at family photos and his early Bethel days. He said a lot of things were familiar.
He did well during a numbers portion of a test in Occupational Therapy.

        <p>Another good day!</p>
<p>I called Shane at 8:30am.
He remembered me leaving last night. He asked if the same couple would bring me back today. He asked if Leah is getting better.
His short term memory is at hard at work.
🤗🤗</p>
<p>We looked at family photos and his early Bethel days. He said a lot of things were familiar.</p>
<p>He did well during a numbers portion of a test in Occupational Therapy.</p>
<p>During Speech therapy, Shane started to ask the therapist all about himself and his career. The therapist said there were few patients in the area with as much conversational nature as he has.</p>
<p>He loved seeing Kari, Milady and Aurelia &amp; Gordon. Also, Uros &amp; Kati and Andrea &amp; Francesca.</p>
<p>Gordon teased him that some people do anything to get out of work and they need him back to do some work at the Kingdom Hall. He said, “Right now, I&rsquo;m just gonna lay here and fall back asleep”</p>
<p>He asked Andrea how their trip was. Francesca told him that the last time they saw him, he was still unconscious. Shane said he didn&rsquo;t remember that. I told him he was unconscious for 7 days. He said he had no idea.</p>
<p>If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, if it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.</li>
<li>Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future</li>
<li>Please help us Thank Jehovah for designing us so generously that we can recover even from accidents that He never meant to happen. Most inventors only invent to cover the need they see, but his designs are so adaptable that they can solve problems that were never meant to exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>He said ** is a waste
Cari defended Shane</p>
<p>do some
The sentences I&rsquo;m saying don&rsquo;t make sense</p>
