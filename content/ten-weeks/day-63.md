### 8:10
Called Shane. He was alert and his headache was gone from the night before. I told him I got a headache overnight and he suggested I rest a little more.

I told him that Tyro and Tiffany Troxell from our congregation would come to eat with us at lunchtime. He said, “Yes! I know them. Oh, I love them. I can't pronounce that... But when you said it I recognized them.” He was so happy his memory triggered right then. 😂🥹🤭👏

### 12:30
He told me he was sitting there going through one memory of the congregation after another. He said he could not describe it out loud, but that for him there were so many memories there.

Tiffany came up and said the lady at the Main Lobby asked Tyro to stay downstairs. Shane was disappointed. Then he said, “I have a stupid idea, why didn't I think of this before? If I go down then we can all be together.” Tiffany and I said it wasn't stupid at all and that we loved the idea. We had lunch in the Main Lobby and Shane transferred himself to the sofa. We sat together and it felt like a lunch date. He loved hearing about their pioneer school and the changes with the Circuit Overseer.

### 2:00
We taped the printer photos of the Kingdom Hall garden onto his dresser. He was thrilled to hear the flowers are doing great, and the pests bothering the trees are under control again.

### 3:00
We watched the last few minutes of the Watchtower study and he hummed the final song of the meeting, number 32 *Take Sides With Jehovah!* 🤗

Watched a movie and did part of the weekend homework from Speech Therapy.

I used the air from one of his balloons and sang him “Jehovah Is Our Refuge.” He laughed and told me to stop it. 😅

### 5:00
He sat in the recliner beside the window to have dinner and I sat in the window seat. The family of deer and the groundhogs came out before the thunderstorm.

### 7:30
The Taylors came up to say goodnight and help me get home. He said he was ready to start another week of therapy and that he hopes the surgery gets scheduled soon. Another good day.

## If you want to help us pray for something, these are our main concerns 💓
1. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery, specifically if Jehovah thinks it's wise to have the date be on or before the 23rd.
2. Please if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah 👏
