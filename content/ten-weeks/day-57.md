I called him. He remembered that the Doctor told him about the telehealth consult and next scheduling the surgery.

### 9:00–12:00
ST  
OT  
PT  
He wore the brace from 10:30–3:30.

### 12:30–1:30
Nap.

### 1:30 PM
Kelsey Pellicone PA said the Telehealth consult is Tuesday Aug 13, 10:00am. 

Shane is very happy about it. Kelsey also agreed to start preventative medication to optimize his blood. Shane thanked her for it. Fortunately, he is in good shape and she agreed to try to keep him that way before and after the surgery.

### 2:30 PM
PT  
He was making the PTs laugh coming out of the gym.

**Shane:** “Oh look out, I'm gonna crash into things.”  
**Laurell:** “There you go again Shane. You're gonna dent our walls.”  
**Shane:** “They're not gonna die.”

He talked with the therapists the entire session. He was not winded at all.

He walked 400 feet. Walked with a cane and didn't need a rest between laps. He walks really steady and seemed energetic. He said, “I'll go again. I'll do as many as you want.”

Nichole the PT put bean bags in random places at the level of the hand rail. Shane walked another 200‑foot lap while picking up the bean bags and putting them in the bucket Nichole carried.

He came back to walk again, this time without the cane. He said “Whoa” and gave them a sideways glance and smile to see if he could make them nervous.  
**Laurell:** “You like to tease us Shane.”  
**Shane:** “Well, I'm not perfect.”  
**Laurell:** “Nobody's perfect.”

He also did 10 stand‑up/sit‑downs from the chair without using his hands.

### 3:00 PM
Laurell finished the PT session and asked Shane to wear the brace until 3:30.

### 3:30 PM
Shane looked at the clock and removed the brace.

### 4:00–5:00 PM
We caught up on spiritual programs. I used a whiteboard to explain the Digital Publishing work I do. He nodded and said he remembered all that.

### 6:00 PM
Justin and Gina came with Chipotle. We sat in the garden. He was very happy about progress with Justin’s car.

### Our Prayer Requests 💓
1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause.  
2. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery.  
3. Please help us thank Jehovah.
