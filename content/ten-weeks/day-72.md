### 7:00 AM  
Called Shane. He was feeling better than the night before. He asked me to read the Day’s Text.

> **“Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to fall.” — Ps. 55:22**  
>  
> Does Jehovah intervene in every situation we encounter? Does he maneuver every event in our life, so that all bad things that happen are for a good reason?  
>  
> No, the Bible does not support that view. (Eccl. 8:9; 9:11)  
>  
> However, we do know this: When we face a trial, Jehovah is aware of it and he hears our cries for help. (Ps. 34:15; Isa. 59:1)  
>  
> More than that, Jehovah can help us endure hardships successfully. How?  
>  
> One way that Jehovah helps us is by providing comfort and encouragement, often just at the right time. (2 Cor. 1:3, 4)  
>  
> Can you think of a time in your life when Jehovah sustained you by providing comfort and encouragement just when you needed it most?  
>  
> Often, it is only after we look back on a hardship that we see how Jehovah helped us get through it.  
> *w23.01 17–18 ¶13–15*

### 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM  
- Occupational Therapy (OT)  
- Physical Therapy (PT)  
- PT again  
- Shane was fitted for a **custom wheelchair** — not forever, just when he’s tired and while waiting for the final skull surgery. It will be sent to us at home once it’s ready.  
- Speech Therapy (ST)

---

### 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM  
Shane took a nap.  
I worked on the arrangements for the assistive devices. The app requires the patient or family to confirm all requests — probably to prevent fraud.

We brought cards and a cake to the **day shift nurses and therapists**.  
In the evening, we brought another for the **night shift**.

---

### 2:25 PM  
Patrick, Shane’s former roommate, came up to see us. He had been at outpatient therapy.  
He said he wished he could have brought Shane a gift. We told him just to keep an opening for when we can have lunch in Bethel.

---

### 2:30 PM – 3:30 PM  
- Speech Therapy (ST)  
- Occupational Therapy (OT)

---

### 4:00 PM  
John Matthews, case manager, had us sign the discharge papers. We thanked him and asked why he chose to display **Lamentations 3:22, 23** on his desk:

> “For his mercies never end. They are new each morning.”

He said that at the end of the day all our energy is used up, and we might feel bad —  
but God renews our energy each morning. And we need that to do the important things each day.

---

Kelsey Pellicone, PA, reviewed the discharge papers they’ll give us tomorrow.  
She confirmed that **Dr. Seliger has no restrictions** for Shane about going outside —  
just to use the helmet and keep an assistive device available in case he gets tired.

---

### 6:00 PM  
We brought a cake up for the evening shift nurses.  
Sastia gave us a big hug and said we have been a bright spot to her —  
that she rarely sees anyone stay so positive through something so hard.

We gave the credit to Jehovah and told her we would message her and looked forward to having her come visit.

---

### 7:00 PM  
The Birners brought me dinner and drove me home.

## 💖 A Note  
Since Shane and I will be back together tomorrow (Wednesday),  
I want to spend more time with him every evening and less time writing on a device.

Please feel free to message **anytime** to ask how he’s doing —  
I’ll get back to you, but I won’t be sending daily updates so I can take advantage of our time together.

Tonight I’ll say a specific prayer thanking Jehovah for *you*.  
Your support and friendship is an unforgettable part of Shane’s recovery — and mine. ☺️🤗  
Love you!
