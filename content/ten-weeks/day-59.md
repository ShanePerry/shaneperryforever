### 8:15 AM
Called Shane. He remembered seeing the doctor. They discussed surgery details.

His original roommate Patrick visited, though we missed him.

### 12:30 PM
John Matthews gave the weekly report: Shane is doing very well; aiming for surgery on or before August 23.

### 2:00 PM
OT. Shane used the handrails to “rocket” through the halls. 🤩

### 2:30 PM
Walked 200 feet, no devices. He noticed the shoe insole issue immediately and asked for correction.

Walked another 200 feet with a cane while conversing.

He did counting‑while‑walking exercises perfectly.

### 5:00 PM
We watched the Hezekiah drama. Shane recognized Juan instantly.

### 7:00 PM
We talked about Tom being from Scotland.

He laughed when hearing Aren taught pioneer school right after the convention.

### 7:30 PM
Jeremy joined for Psalm 74 and prayer.

Shane asked me to leave a little early so I could get home before dark.

### Our Prayer Requests 💓
1. Please ask Jehovah to guide the plans for surgery, especially timing.  
2. Please help us know the original cause of the fall.  
3. Please help us thank Jehovah.
