### 7:40 AM  
Called Shane. He said the doctor had come to assess him, and they took him to measure something—probably weight. Then he said a few more brothers came and checked him. He said he is happy there are only three days left and he is ready to leave.

He listened to the end of morning worship with me. He said, *“Once I'm there I can listen to that more often, I can't wait.”*  
He also said, *“It occurs to me there's a lot of interesting things happening there and I want to help.”*

He asked how it went last night. I told him about the drain that let a strong sewer smell come into our room until I ran water down it. He said he was sorry I had to deal with that.

He asked what I will do today, and I explained the plans.

Kelsey Pellicone, PA, said they will arrange for discharge at **10:30 AM on Wednesday**. She will get the prescriptions called in and the other discharge items requested.

### 2:15 PM  
EKG

### 2:30 PM  
**PT:**  
Shane walked **600 feet with no device**. I assisted beside him. Laurell trained me to walk with him and do stairs. We also practiced getting in and out of the car.

She said she ordered a **custom wheelchair** to his size. It will be sent to Bethel when it’s ready. In the meantime, we will temporarily use a wheelchair that Bethel has. I will bring the temporary wheelchair at the time of discharge.

**OT:**  
Mallory told us she is Dr. Seliger’s daughter.

### 4:00 PM  
Sastia, the nurse, came to check his evening vitals. Shane said:

> *“I really hope you know that one day I hope you can be where we are.”*

She said she will come, that she really wants to see the Bible museum. We told her about the **Biblia Sacra** — one of our favorite Bibles because **Michael Servetus** gave his life to translate it.

### 4:30 PM  
Shane felt good enough to sit outdoors until dinner. The weather was perfect. After dinner he took another short nap.

---

### 6:00–6:30 PM  
We looked at pictures from Mexico. He told me as many things about it as he remembered. He even knew names I didn’t.

Then he had a headache and asked me to get home before dark. The Howells helped me pick up two cakes to take for the nurses tomorrow and drove me home.

---

### 8:00 PM  
I called him to let him know I got home. He said the headache was better and he was ready to sleep.

## 💓 Prayer Requests

1. **Thankfulness:**  
   Please help us thank Jehovah for Shane’s excellent recovery and for giving us opportunities to praise Him because of this experience.

2. **Seeds of Truth:**  
   Please ask for Jehovah’s spirit to help any seeds of truth grow from this stay at Helen Hayes. Shane and I want to treat this like our final week in unassigned territory.

3. **Clarity and Peace:**  
   If necessary to prevent a future fall, help us know the original cause of the fall. And please help us feel peace when/if the prayer has been answered.
