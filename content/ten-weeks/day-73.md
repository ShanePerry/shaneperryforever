### 7:00 AM  
Called Shane. We read the Day’s Text:

> **“The wild beast that *was* but *is not* . . . goes off into destruction.” — Rev. 17:11**  
>
> This wild beast looks almost the same as the seven‑headed wild beast, except that it is scarlet-colored. It is called “the image of the wild beast” and is described as “an eighth king.” (Rev. 13:14, 15; 17:3, 8)  
>
> This “king” is spoken of as coming into existence, then going out of existence, and later reappearing. This fits the United Nations very well: first as the League of Nations, then going out of existence during World War II, and then re‑emerging in its present form.  
>
> By means of propaganda, the political beasts stir up opposition to Jehovah and his people, symbolically gathering “the kings of the entire inhabited earth” to Armageddon.  
> *—w22.05 10 ¶10–11*

We also read Cindy’s message, which touched both of us deeply:

> **“Dear ones… we got home at 5 am and I’m trying to put my life together and it made me think of you two!  
> What a marvel it has been reading your texts every day.  
> You taught us well by real life and seeing Jehovah’s blessings.  
> You and Shane encouraged us so much by how you faced your challenges.  
> Just beautiful.  
>
> I’m glad you will finally return to some normal.  
> You’re even showing much wisdom in how you will be doing that!  
> Truly proof Jehovah is with you both. 💗  
>
> Going home tomorrow — wow.  
> What a stretch it has been, but what miracles you have experienced.  
>
> Shane and you will be able to sit down with Job and his wife and cross notes.  
>
> We love you both.  
> May your day coming home have Jehovah’s spirit and the true joy that comes with it.  
>
> Our warmest love,  
> Bob and Cindy.”**

### 9:20 AM  
Called Shane. We were getting ready to get in the van. We were packed and going to pick up his prescriptions — insurance paid for them.

He said:

> “That’s great, Cheekies. You know what? I’ve been thinking. I can beat this. It’s not gonna be easy and I’ll have to think really hard, but I *can* beat this.”

Shane was cheerful and positive.  
He was excited to come home, and he even said he was sure he could beat this.

That gives me so much comfort — knowing his thoughts were happy and not discouraged.  
He knew:

- he is loved  
- he is wanted  
- and Bethel is his home that he is coming back to  

He was not conscious of anything after he collapsed, so he didn’t have pain or anxiety.  
He’s resting now, and nothing can hurt him.

That gives me relief.  

**Satan couldn’t take him from Jehovah.  
He won.**

I feel the deepest pain I’ve had yet.  
But I’m also determined to be happy too.

Shane told me one week ago — and two weeks ago — that if something happened to him, to do my assignment and be happy.  
And I will.

Shane’s life is far from over.  
We can start planning the welcome‑back party.

### 11:00 AM  
After the three doctors left, Dr. Hall stayed (he is the one who wants to volunteer here). Then two physicians came in.

I told Kelsey that everything she did was right, and that Shane had faith in Jehovah — and that Jehovah can fix this in the new world.

Then Sweetie asked:

> “Are you one of JW?”

I said yes, we both are.

She asked:

> “What Kingdom Hall do you go to?”

I said **Pomona Route 202**.

She asked:

> “Do you know Dr. Howard? She is my best friend. She tells me about Jehovah, and I get so mad at her because she tells me what Jehovah will want me to do. But she is my best friend because she tells me what is right and what is wrong.”
