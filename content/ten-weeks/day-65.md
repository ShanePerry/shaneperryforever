Chris Fairley from HLC came and brought us a spiritual gem. Job felt like his plans and the desires of his heart were shattered.

Job 17:11 “My days are finished; My plans, the desires of my heart, have been shattered.”

Job rightly felt like he had lost. At the same time, he could not have known yet all the ways Jehovah would reward his obedience. What matters is what are the desires of Jehovah's heart, nothing can shatter what He decides to do.

### 4:00
A Spanish speaking worker came in to do a task. And Shane started a conversation with him in Spanish. The man is from Guatemala and still has family there. We got to tell him about our ministry there.

### 5:00
The nurse asked if the medical area Shane might eventually be discharged to is like an SNF, which she called a “sniff.” Shane knew that she was describing a skilled nursing facility and answered “yes.” He understood the question before I knew what she meant.

### 5:30
Shane watched a video related to his work.

### 6:00
We looked at pictures from Guatemala and Mexico. In a picture of the Nahuatl de la Huasteca translation team, Shane pointed to Fabian, a translator and said, “He’s the only one who is still there.” And he's right, Fabian is the only member of the original NHH team.

I pointed at a brother in a picture of us in Bethel Laundry orientation and I said, “I don't know who that is.” He said, “Yes you do.” I asked, “Is that Vite?” and he said yes.

### 7:15
Liliana Cruz came up and we chatted about Mexico Bethel. He was happy to see her. Abrahan waited downstairs for us. Then we drove home together a little early at Shane's request.

## If you want to help us pray for something, these are our main concerns 💓
1. Please help us Thank Jehovah for Shane's excellent recovery and for giving us opportunities to praise him because of this experience. 👏
2. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery, specifically regarding the timing of it.
3. Please if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, help us know the original cause of the fall. And please help us feel peace when/if the prayer has been answered.
