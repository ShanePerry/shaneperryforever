August 25, 2024 — **Sunday**

### 7:15
Called Shane. He was well rested and chatty. He said he has many questions, but that he will have to ask some questions later when he can find the words.

He asked me to explain how long he had been in the hospital. He asked how it was going to work to transfer his care to Bethel and what the therapy goals will be. He said maybe we can attend a meeting together in person in the future, though we don’t know if we can attend Long Meadow. We planned to watch the meeting on stream. He asked who would drive me today. He also asked if, when we go outdoors today, we could see a different part of the hospital.

### 12:00
He waited for me to arrive to start lunch. He said he wanted to be out of bed for a while. He stood up, walked around the room, and arranged a few things from his bedside to the nightstand.

I set up the recliner beside the window, and he wheeled the lunch cart over to eat there. I sat in the window seat. He asked if I noticed how many sailboats were out, the remote‑controlled airplane, and the young deer.

After lunch, Johnny Becerra dropped off Five Guys. Shane made sure we ate all the french fries while they were still hot. We wrapped the cheeseburger and put it in the fridge for dinner.

He finished **2 liters of water plus a coffee and ginger ale** by 12:30. 👏

### 1:00
We watched the weekend meeting on stream. The illustration in the Public Talk about creation made us laugh—the one about animals being powerful and clever. The brother talked about an orangutan in the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle: a storm blew a large branch into the enclosure. Two zookeepers couldn’t lift it and left to get a chainsaw. In the meantime, a female orangutan saw their struggle, walked over, picked up the branch, and threw it over the fence. 😅

Shane hummed part of the song and said our concluding prayer after the meeting ended. It was excellent.

### 3:00
He asked if we could go outside, but to a **new** area of the hospital. We chose the picnic area outside the cafeteria. I told him stories that *he* had told me about his childhood.

He said he is remembering so much and wants to think about how the therapy in Bethel can best help him regain ability. He practiced pronouncing a word that had been hard for him to remember. I asked him to put his hand on my mouth to feel how I said it. He imitated it successfully after that.

### 4:30
Elby, RN (the one that Eric Loff witnessed to), came to take afternoon vitals. Shane invited her to come visit us at Warwick. She gave us her number and said I could send her a video of the Bible museum.

Her family is Evangelical Christian from India. She said she uses the King James Bible. So we told her she could see an original first edition King James from 1611.

### 5:00
Benji brought Shane dinner and told us she got our message yesterday. Shane told her he’d like to take her with us. She laughed *really* hard. 😅

### 6:00
Shane made sure we did our Bible Reading before I had to go home. He remembered exactly where we had left off and that we needed to finish the last half of the chapter.

### 7:00
Shane told Adrian how glad he will be to leave the hospital and get back home. He asked me to get home before dark.

## If you want to help us pray for something, these are our main concerns 💓

1. **Please help us thank Jehovah** for Shane’s excellent recovery and for giving us opportunities to praise Him because of this experience. 👏
2. **Please ask for Jehovah's spirit** to help any seeds of truth grow from this stay at Helen Hayes. Shane and I want to treat this like our final week in unassigned territory.
3. **Please, if it’s necessary to prevent a future fall, help us know the original cause**, and help us feel peace when/if the prayer has been answered.
