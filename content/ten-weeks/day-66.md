### We Have Good News! 👏
Shane will be discharged on August 28, Wednesday. He will come back to Warwick Bethel Infirmary and wait for the final surgery, scheduled September 25. Of course, if there is an opening for surgery earlier we would take it. For now, we love this plan! 💗

### 8:10
I called Shane. He asked if the weather was still cold like it had been recently. He said he wanted to ask the Dr. about leaving the hospital.

### 10:00–12:00
PT  
ST  
OT

### 12:00
John Matthews, the case manager, said Dr. Seliger agrees that Shane can wait for surgery at the Warwick Bethel Infirmary. They will discharge him, August 28, Wednesday.

### 2:00–3:30
OT  
PT (1 hour session)  
Standing toe taps to three cones in sequence and then in reverse order. The cones are set in front of him in a wide triangle. It is to test keeping all the weight and balance on one leg while changing position. He made them laugh because he did amazing with it. But they didn't notice at first that he was grabbing the wall, which they said was cheating. 😅
Parallel bars, sit down/stand up and throw the 1.5 ft ball to the therapist.

We told Laurell about his discharge date. She said she will train me more for walking with him in the hallways. And she will order the devices he may need for a while, likely a wheelchair and cane. They gave him elastic shoe laces to make it easier to put his shoes on. He asked me to keep the original shoe laces. 

### 3:00
Vibhuti, the sister of the neighbor patient, told me her sister, Priti, had a stroke in early June at her son's Cricket game. 
Vibhuti said she is grateful that her sister's stroke happened while at the game and not while she was driving. She is a young mother of 2 children. Her sister is with her daily. And her husband comes every evening and is cleared to walk with her because he is a Physical Therapist. They will be discharged on Saturday. 

### 3:45
Chivonne left a voice message for us confirming the plans for the Infirmary. This  helped Shane believe it would actually happen. He seems to feel content after so many weeks of uncertainty.

### 4:00
The evening Dr. came and asked specifics about the arrangements at the infirmary. We explained that there is licensed medical staff on site. And it has fall protection. He was surprised that there could be volunteer staff to do all the things we described. He asked if he could volunteer too. 😅😍 He said we have been a bright spot in his floor. And that he's glad that Shane has progressed. He said after surgery Shane will be reevaluated by the Westchester Physical Therapy department to assess the need for Inpatient treatment at Helen Hayes rehab. 

### 4:30
Sastia RN came to check vitals and we told her the good news that Shane will be discharged. We said the only problem is that we can't take her with us. Shane made a joke and offered her a shift at the infirmary. 😅 She laughed. We asked if we could stay in touch and exchanged phone numbers. 

### 6:00
Handy and Griselda Gomez came to see us. They came to bring me dinner and drive me home. Shane told Handy that every morning he can watch the sunrise over the Hudson river. He says it's beautiful.

### 7:00
We did Bible Reading, Psalm 77. He said I should get home before it's dark. And asked that tomorrow we start taking down the things in the room to prepare to move home. 💕

## If you want to help us pray for something, these are our main concerns 💓
1. Please help us Thank Jehovah for Shane's excellent recovery and for giving us opportunities to praise him because of this experience. 👏
2. Please ask for Jehovah's spirit to help any seeds of truth to grow…
3. Please if it's necessary to prevent a future fall…

Shane was concerned that Bethel needed to know more about his condition. And he didn't want to be a burden. Chivonne confirmed that all the necessary parties were aware and were welcoming Shane back with open arms. 


Shane said if he dies he wants me to be cared for. He asked if I have the passwords and all the money. He told me to do my Bethel work, be happy and he was mixing up pronouns because of the Aphasia, so he told me to find a “girl” who loves me that and I love “her” and marry “her.” I told him that he is doing better than ever and there’s no doubt he will survive the injuries and next surgery. If he overcame the injuries and surgeries so far, the next one will be much easier. He said “all the same, you heard what I said.” I said yes I did. I told him I have everything thanks to him organizing all our important details into a vault. And that he is doing well physically. He is not ill. He is injured. And he is recovering well. He said he feels bad because I have helped him so much and he feels he can't do anything for me. I told him that he saved my life in San Dionisio. When he made them bring an ambulance from the Centro de Salud to come get me when I was sick.
