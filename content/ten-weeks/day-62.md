### 9:00 AM
Called Shane. He noticed I called a little later than usual. He asked if everything was ok. I told him I had slept in. He said sometimes extra rest is all you need.

### 12:00 PM
Shane said he was waiting for me with an idea when I arrived. He said he had energy because they didn't plan any therapy for him. He asked if I wanted to go outside. We sat out for 45 minutes in the gazebo in the garden.

As we left the room he spotted Jonathan, one of his nurses who had recently returned from the cruise. Shane remembered that and asked him how it was. The other staff overheard and gave him thumbs up for recalling that.

### 1:15 PM
We moved the recliner by the window and had lunch with a view of the river. The change of scenery was nice.

### 3:00 PM
Watched the Public Talk and Watchtower Study on stream. Shane softly mouthed the words of the songs.

### 4:30 PM
Sastía, RN, said all Shane's vitals and latest blood work is all 100% in range. She said she is very happy when patient look as good as he does.

### 5:00 PM
He asked to call his parents. He was so pleased to hear that the Circuit Overseer visited them for an encouraging shepherding call that morning. Shane explained the plans for surgery. Betty said she'll buy a ticket the instant we know the date. Shane was happy he'll see her again. Bill said he has been feeling well and is drinking more water to prevent a kidney problem. Bill told Shane he is pleased because Miguel, the caregiver, bought him a pair of sunglasses for when he goes to Doctor appointments. 😊

### 6:00 PM
We listened to my Grandma Vesta's Memorial via Zoom in Shelton, Washington.

### 7:00–7:30 PM
Peter and Nia Price came by and told their field ministry experiences. And how much LDC is progressing worldwide. Shane told them that he thinks his Medical care has been good because he has had a team of Neurologists and other specialists.

Jay and Karyn Jackson brought me dinner and drove me home. Shane had gotten a headache so he asked us to end the night early and get home before dark.

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓

1. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery, specifically if Jehovah thinks it's wise to have the date be on or before the 23rd.
2. Please if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah 👏

We messaged Megan and Eli. The two people we know who work at WMC.

He had a nap at 5:00 and woke up very logical and talking about how he wanted things to improve. I told him about try-fail-try-fail-try-succeed. We read the g92 about replacing negative thoughts for positive ones. And he recognized it and asked if it is one of ours (a theocratic publication) because it mentioned the kingdom. He also raised his right arm and started scratching his head with his right hand.
