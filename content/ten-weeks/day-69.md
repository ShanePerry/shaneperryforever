August 24, 2024 — **Saturday**

### 7:30
Called Shane. He was happy and awake early. We talked about what we will do since there is no therapy on Saturday. I told him Esther, Sofi and Caleb will come at the end of the day to drive me home. He asked me to buy him a few things to have when he gets back to Bethel. He asked what time exactly Esther, Sofi and Caleb would come. We read the Day's Text. When breakfast arrived we ended the call.

### 9:00
Shower

### 11:00–12:00
Nap  
Lunch  
Speech therapy homework

### 1:30–3:00
Nap  
We had a long conversation after he rested. He said after he sleeps he feels like it's easier to find words and many memories come back to him. He said he hopes the Bethel schedule will include breaks for rest because he can tell he does better afterwards. He said he has so many more questions but he will have to wait to find the words for it.

### 4:00–5:00
We sat outside in the garden. We watched the goldfinches eating seeds from the purple cone flower heads. There was a remote control airplane fair, and we could see the planes racing in the air. He said many times what a perfect and beautiful day it was. Patrick and Antoinette Ting came and brought us early dinner. Shane asked them to tell him anything that was new. They talked about camping and the upcoming Patterson peach harvest.

### 6:00
We got the phone number for Benji, one of the aides that Shane invited to come see us. She said she would like to. We will arrange that as soon as possible.

Shane asked me to take the poster boards down and store them carefully so we can set them up again at home. We simplified what we have in the room so there's just a minimum to take home on the day he gets discharged.

### 7:00
Esther and Sofi came to drive me home. They asked about the surgery and the upcoming discharge. Sofi said she starts Junior year on Tuesday, September 3rd. Shane asked us to get home early; it got too late.

## If you want to help us pray for something, these are our main concerns 💓

1. Please help us thank Jehovah for Shane's excellent recovery and for giving us opportunities to praise Him because of this experience. 👏
2. Please ask for Jehovah's spirit to help any seeds of truth to grow from this stay at Helen Hayes. Shane and I want to treat this like our final week in unassigned territory.
3. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, help us know the original cause of the fall. And please help us feel peace when/if the prayer has been answered.
