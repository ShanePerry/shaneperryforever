### 8:15 AM
Called Shane. He slept well. Had the early morning visit with the Neurologist. He was upbeat about how it went.

### 9:00–12:00 PM
OT  
ST  
PT  
OT

### 11:00 AM
Kelsey Pellicone, PA, called. She said the PA for Dr. Wainwright will return on Monday and then her counterpart can work on getting the schedule for the surgery.

Shane asked me to describe the process of planning and scheduling the surgery, so I used the whiteboard and drew it the best I could. He said that made sense.

### 12:00–2:00 PM
Nap block.  
Lunch.

### 2:00–3:00 PM
**ST**  
He got himself ready ahead of time for ST and sat at the window outside the room to enjoy the view before Tara came. I showed him a setting on his watch so he can find the date.

**PT**  
Walked 400 feet with minimal PT assist — the farthest I have seen so far (though I never see morning sessions). He carried a small weight in his right hand to develop balance. He chatted and smiled the whole time; he had good energy.

### 4:00 PM
I'm cleared to help transfer to the restroom by walking. We can still use the wheelchair whenever he is really tired or not feeling well. He is very steady walking. This is good progress.

Sastía, RN, said because Shane is walking so much now, she will send a question to the Neurologist about whether he still needs to be on the medication to avoid blood clots.

### 5:00–7:00 PM
We relaxed, watched movies, and did our Bible Reading.

### 7:00 PM
Brett and Margaret Burckholter came up, and Margaret said he looked so much better than when she had seen him 5 weeks ago in ICU.

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓

1. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery, specifically if Jehovah thinks it's wise to have the date be on or before the 23rd.
2. Please if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah 👏
