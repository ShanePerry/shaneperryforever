CT scan with stealth, no contrast, at Good Samaritan. Leah and I went straight into Radiology and arrived just as they were checking Shane in. The Aide let me be with him for consent forms. They were very fast and took Shane back early. He stretched out on the CT bed. He held his head as he laid flat. And said it felt horrible. I got the impression he felt dizzy or pain from changing position. He said after 1-2 minutes he felt better. He was too far up on the CT bed, so they helped him reposition lower on the bed. The ceiling had two large flat screen TVs and they were playing a very peaceful ocean video. 

He had his water bottle with him and had drank the whole liter of water.

I drove Leah and myself back to Helen Hayes lobby and waited. The nurses said they couldn't do early visitation. But they let us call him and he was sleeping comfortably.

Hendy Gomez, a sister from our congregation , who works at the hospital went upstairs to check on him and get his therapy schedule. He will have therapy this afternoon based on his energy.

His RN noticed us sitting in the Main Lobby on her coffee break and she told us to tell the front desk that she needed a meeting with us. It was true, they needed Shane to sign a form to give me rights as proxy in preparation for the upcoming surgery.

Shane woke up after a 2 hour nap. He said he felt very refreshed. And he was happy I drove today, so I could take Leah to do something together. We planned on tacos for lunch.

Leah and I got Delicias Mexicanas tacos. Shane said he could hear us chomping on them even though he wore earplugs. 😊 After that he got another nap.

Laurell took him to walk with the tall walker. He looked content and was chatting with them the whole time. 

He reached out to hold my hand with his right hand a few times. The right hand is progressing slower when compared his left hand, but it is still improving. When he had to sign the proxy form, he used his right hand to sign. 

## 5:00-7:00
We watched movies, including a YouTube about Rio Blanco, Nicaragua. We lived there from 2010-2012. The video is just a drive down the principal streets of the town. After a minute Shane recognized it and was pointing out familiar places 

## 7:00
Leah made a timeline of Shanes progress. He was very interested in hearing how he improved from “nothing”, as he described it, to where he's at now. He said he's noticed this past week that remembering things is easier than before. 

## 8:00
We exchanged numbers with Nick, Shane's roommate, because he leaves tomorrow. He said he really wants us to visit someday when we are in Pine Bush. He said, “we've been this close for this long…we might as well keep it going.”


If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah
