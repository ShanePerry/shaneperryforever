Shane got 3.5 hours of therapy today.

He transferred to the chair. Sam and I played a card game with him. We played War and he took every trick but the last. We tied and then I had the last high card. 💗

He also went to the PT room and then went to a hallway where they practiced standing and sitting and taking steps. He did great. And insisted that he lift himself by pushing off the armrests of the chair. 

He also asked them a ton of questions about how long they would work with him. And if they had done it before.

He slept very soundly in between sessions. And when he woke up, he was more alert than I'd seen yet. 


They removed the trach. He seems so relieved. It's bandaged and we can hear his voice clearly. 

He got upgraded to normal food. Dinner was the first meal. Fish, mashed potatoes and gravy, beets, apple juice, milk, yogurt and fruit juice. He said it tasted good. 

At that moment Gary and Christia Blackburn were there. And he asked if we had come just to watch him eat. 😅

He also had dozens of questions, including how long things were going to last. Also about what Gary and Christia had done for work that day. He asked about getting a cabin. We believe that means a Wallkill cabin. Because Gary had told him about a possible camping trip in the fall. He asked question after question and laughed really hard a few times. Including when Gary put the helmet on. 

He asked why he was there. We got to explain what happened. He said he didn't remember any of that. 

After we mentioned him falling outside the office, then he asked for Jeremy by name about four times on different occasions. ☺️

He asked for us to sit down, I think he was enjoying the company and didn't want it to end. 

We read him his poster board. He likes it including the Chick-fil-A logo we drew him. 

Leah and I played him music and then the Daniel drama and later Sam finished watching it with him, while I had dinner downstairs. They said a prayer together. Then I came back up. We did Bible reading and he was Out! 

The care manager said the doctors plan to request 6 weeks of rehab. They will request it from insurance one week at a time. They said this is all normal.

This really was the best day yet. His questions 
were great. He's hungry for more input! 



If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns 

1. Please help Shane have strength to do the therapy 
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
