### 8:50 AM
Called Shane. He was eating breakfast and preparing for therapy. We kept the call short so he could finish.

### 1:30 PM
Patrick, Shane's original roommate, visited. He came for an outpatient appointment and is doing so well. 👏😊

He was surprised at how much Shane has recovered. He suggested Shane write a book or documentary about his success with God's help, saying it will inspire people.

He said it also impresses him that Shane and I have stuck together. He said many people leave their families when there are serious problems. I told him what they don't know is that when you do things Jehovah’s way, He gives you the energy to do it. If you go your own way, you're alone. Jehovah makes the way to do what's right.

He asked several questions about how donations are used. When he learned that everyone is a volunteer at Bethel, even very professional people, he said, “People like that could be making $200 an hour,” and then said a bad word in surprise. 🤭

Shane invited him to come to Bethel when we are back home to watch a Bible video and talk more. Patrick said he has always wanted to come and when brother Dellinger invited him, he was very interested.

### 2:00 PM
RN Marie Claude did wound care. The wounds on his feet are looking great. They will give us some supplies so we can protect him if he gets a small bed when he goes back to Westchester Hospital.

### 2:30 PM
Kelsey Pellicone, PA, said she reached out to the Westchester scheduler to work on the date for surgery and that she will ask again tomorrow.

### 2:30–3:30 PM
OT  
PT  
He did 20 Stand Up/Sit Downs from the chair without using his arms. Legs only.  
OT

### 4:00 PM
The doctor came and assessed Shane's memory. Shane correctly answered that he is 6’7 and that the surgery should be scheduled within 1 or 2 weeks. The doctor said that Shane has made a marked improvement in the last week.

He told Shane to keep expressing every concern while he is here, including his worry about not being able to return to his assignment. He said I can help Shane by reassuring him and giving accurate information.

The doctor said many patients express concern that their life won't be the same and something will be lost. Many worry about their mates or children abandoning them or being replaced at their jobs. He said this is a common experience for patients and that family and friends can help by reassuring them that it won't happen.

Shane thanked him and said he has asked that Jehovah keep giving the doctor His spirit.

### 5:00 PM
We watched the mid-week meeting.

### 6:00–7:00 PM
Uros and Kati came for Bible Reading. Shane was so happy to hear that Jesus and Dilcia will be going to SKE.

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓

1. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery, specifically if Jehovah thinks it's wise to have the date be on or before the 23rd.
2. Please if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah 👏
