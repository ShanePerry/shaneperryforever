8:30 I called him. He had a good night. He was waiting for breakfast and physical therapy. He said that Physical Therapy is "the hard one, she's always got stuff for me to do.” We practiced the date and he got July correct! Still working on the day itself. He was happy Betty is home safe. And liked hearing about Kev’s work in the basement.

9:00am
Walked 800ft with the walker
Walked 100ft with PT assist
Walked over hurdles. 
Laurell noticed Shane has double vision and was heading to the right of the hurdles. She said she'll let Dr. Seliger know. Also they may use eye patches to help with double vision.

We also mentioned the double vision to the PA and there is a referral with the eye doctor.

12:30pm
Speech therapy with Karl during lunch. Shane told Karl “We don't know if we will stay, but Jehovah will help us.” Karl commended him for his faith. He said it will help the recovery. Karl also said, Shane is cleared to eat on his own now. No requirement for a companion.

1:00pm Dr visit in the room.
They asked him if we have children. He told the doctor, "No, but she has a sister, she's retired ☺️ and she has a brother and I think they have four of those.”

The PA removed the left over staple from the surgical site. And a left over suture from the JP drain site. They are all healing well. Still looking for the peg tube to be removed. We are at 5 weeks. Westchester ICU said they would remove at 6 weeks, not sooner to allow proper healing. Helen Hayea says they may remove sooner, but regardless we're close and he's doing very well. 


2:30pm
Walked 400ft with the walker
Walked 200ft with PT assist 
Laurell wrapped his right foot around the calf and forefoot to give an additional cue to bring the forefoot up, while walking. She said she'll request a temporary orthotic for it.

Laurell-You ok Shane, you getting dizzy?
Shane-You'll know if I do
Laurell-*chuckle. No, I wanna know now. You tell me. 


## 4:00
Pictures of Nicaragua. He said he remembered many things. Even remembered Sister Araceli and that she passed away from COVID.

## 6:45
He saw Youn when she walked in and smiled,
“Oh there's that bad one…uh the bad sweet one”

## 7:00
Jeremy showed a demo of the HuB app
S-This is amazing Bro
J-Lets test it, we will send in the request
“Big Daddy Shane get some rest”
You can also send message or file
S-That's amazing
J-Submitted 
S-That's amazing bro
J-You did a lot
S-I didn't do anything. I just got everybody interested. 
J-You did more than that
S-I don't know. Maybe they're just gonna send me out.
J-Then you can stay with me in my office.

J-So that's the web app. We're getting the chance to adjust it 
S-That's wonderful. Even if Jehovah doesn't want us to use it very long. It's gonna be a simplification. Even for reimbursements it's gonna be a simplification.

S-When is it gonna reach the field?
J-September.
S-Who knows maybe by the time I get home in August I can help


The nurse came to bring his meds. He used the button on the bed to bring up the head of the bed. He realized we were all staring at him and he said, “See, I'm just gonna move this real slow and everybody is gonna say, ‘Wow.’”
😅


J-So you can go outside?
V-yes, I can push him around in the wheelchair and Shane points which way to go
S-Yea, I'm just riding around saying, what the heck. ☺️

One of us mentioned Jonathan, who is a Physical Therapist in Bethel….
Shane-Oh right, they are coming on Tuesday and I'm scared to death.
Vanessa-That’s Wednesday, to prepare for your transfer in a few weeks.
Jeremy-Why are you scared to death?
Shane-Because I don't even know what's going on. 💛

Jeremy said our evening prayer for us. Then he and I took two old helium balloons and it made our voices high pitch. Shane ended the night with a good belly laugh at that. 


If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. We have been praying these consistently. So maybe we can also ask Him to make it clear if he has answered this prayer. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah!!
