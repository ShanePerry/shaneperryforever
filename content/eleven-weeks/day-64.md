August 19, 2024 — **Monday**

### 8:30
Called Shane. He was waiting for breakfast. He knew his therapy schedule already and wanted to plan what he and I would do together today.

### 9:00–12:00
OT  
ST  
PT  
ST

### 12:00–12:30
Nap (20 minutes)  
Dr. Seliger came to say he still hopes to get the surgery as soon as possible but it might not be as soon as he would like. Over the next few days they and we will talk more.

### 1:00
Lunch. He had Bethel Ravioli and Parmesan cheese 😊

### 2:00
OT  
Shane was ready for OT and wheeled himself to the therapy room and arrived on time. Usually the therapist comes to get him. The therapist looked up and smiled when she saw how punctual he was and that he got there himself.  
PT  
He told the Physical Therapist he wasn't feeling very well. She decided to bring him back and let him rest. The nurses checked him; everything was normal. So he napped for 1 hour.

### 4:00
He woke up feeling much better. The therapist said the PT session could be added on tomorrow.

### 5:00
Kyle & Chivonne visited. The main lobby wouldn't let them both come up, so Shane decided he could go downstairs and we all sat together at the sofas. He really appreciated their experiences. He told them that your mind can mess with you and make you believe you're not doing well, when you actually are. He told them many of his memories are coming back and he can move from one to the next.

### 6:00
Youn & Jeremy brought dinner, visited, then drove me home. Jeremy and Shane got to talk about work. Each conversation helps him remember more and more.

## If you want to help us pray for something, these are our main concerns 💓
1. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery, specifically regarding the timing of it.
2. Please if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah 👏

At 4:40 he used the putty and shaped and squeezed it in his left hand. Then stretched it from his right hand to the left.

To Kyle, Shane asked, “So how long were you — together?” Kyle understood and asked, “Like ‘how long were we away?’” 🥲

His latest trick is to grin at me and wobble around while I'm trying to get him out of the restroom — just to make me nervous 😅  
Of course, as he walks in… it's all business. 🚽 But as he walks out, it's fun and games.
