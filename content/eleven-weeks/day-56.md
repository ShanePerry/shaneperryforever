Called Shane. He was having breakfast. He asked what Leah and I would do today. He also said if something happens to him, I should go on and have a happy life. I said I only want him and he's gonna survive. He said, “Ok let's do that. But I'm just saying I want you to know.” He may have been thinking about the upcoming surgery. Because we were talking about preventing a blood management problem. The surgery has a low risk of bleeding. But we will be prepared.

Leah prepared something to say to Godfrey the security guard. Because earlier this week he showed us a 3000 pound sea turtle, 400 years old and it troubled him that the earth is being poorly cared for and that people are so aggressive. He said he agrees these are the last days and that he has appreciated the kind visitors that are here for Shane. At the end of the conversation he asked if we know Tim Burns, an elder in our congregation, who came one afternoon to see Shane. He said Tim has his number and he doesn't think these conversations are an accident. Also, he appreciates the good vibes we give off. ☺️
Almost every day the workers say to one of our guests, "You must be visiting Shane Perry. We can tell by how you look and act."

He was eating lunch. He had a better appetite than the day before.

The view out the window cleared up and it was a beautiful sunny day. He looked up and spotted the vultures circling, riding a thermal about 1000 feet. He also saw a tug boat pushing a barge up the river. He said he wondered what the cargo was.

He had some memories of work. So he talked about what he could remember and Leah recommended I make pictures of what I understood. With that method we realized he was talking about facets of Special Full Time service that receive healthcare. He thought there were around 15 and maybe a few more.

Leah played him a video she likes from the 2022 Regional Convention about patience.

## 2:00
Leah got a ride to Newark airport with the Germosen family. Shane sat up to give her a hug. Shane and I watched the Public Talk and Watchtower study.

## 4:00
We sat outdoors in the garden for almost an hour with Antoinette and Patrick. He was very happy to hear she is commuting and he is doing remote work. He asked a lot of questions about what they are doing in their work.

## 6:30
Brian and Jen came to visit and brought me dinner. Shane remembered that Jen's Mom was getting a new apartment built in her son's house. Also, he remembered that a few years ago, we had a BBQ together when the Martins’ friends overnighted some excellent Texas brisket. At first he thought he didn't remember….then the memory flooded in and he said with surprise “Wait, I do remember that. I remember! Also Brian told him that he and Jen are going to Ireland, planning visit the castle from Monty Python and get the complimentary coconuts to make the sound of the galloping horses. Shane said he remembered that scene in the movie.
Brian said our prayer for the evening.

## 7:45
Shane remembered that the next day he would have more therapy. He said if I wanted to leave before 8:00, then he would sleep early.

2. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery.
