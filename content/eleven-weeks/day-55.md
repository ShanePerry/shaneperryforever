Called Shane. We told him we were on a walk outside and the weather was so beautiful after Tropical Storm Debby. He said he was happy we did something together.

## 9:00
ST

When we walked in his room, he remembered about the walk and asked us how it went. Nick Shane's roommate, went home in the morning and he sent us a message to say Hi to Shane and that he hopes to see us again. 

## 12:30
Kristine the RN came in. She said she overheard Leah reading something interesting out loud as she walked in the room. She asked if she could have a copy, maybe take a photo of Leah's phone screen. Leah got her number and sent her a link to the Creator book. She said she would read it. We said later that independently both of us had prayed for Jehovah to help us find an opportunity to talk about Him today. Leah had prepared to talk to the security guard, but it turned out the message was meant for the nurse instead. 🤗

PT
Walked 1000 feet with the standing walker. 
He kept conversation going with the Physical Therapists the entire time. He asked what they will do tomorrow, Sunday, and how they design their schedules. 

## 2:00
We went outside for 45 minutes. And someone dropped off Shane Chick-fil-A for mid-afternoon snack. 

## 4:00
Felipe &amp; Stacy came after our meeting. They had him laughing. 

## 5:00
Watched an encouraging talk about Peace from Shane's department. I got to tell Shane how one nurse in particular was puzzled how we could be so calm and kind despite the crisis. 

## 7:00
Leah got to meet Sofia &amp; Caleb. They came to the lobby and Leah went downstairs with them
…while Shane finished dinner.

Also Andrew &amp; Katie Sabbag came with dinner for me and Leah and to drive us home. They encouraged us with reading 
Ps 71:7
“I have become like a miracle to many, But you are my strong refuge”

Shane realized he hadn't seen Leah for a while. He asked me to have her come back upstairs. He couldn't get her name exactly right so he called her ‘the one who is always with you’ 💓 We did Bible Reading and planned to watch the meeting Sunday since there's no therapy and it's really quiet in the room now. 
He went to bed early. Another great day.


If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah



In PT Shane started talking about the Watchtower as he was going over the hurdles. The therapists didn't understand what Watchtower is. But we did.
