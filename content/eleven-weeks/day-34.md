He had less activities today, so there was extra time for social and rest.

On the phone this morning I said they'd probably be bringing him breakfast soon. He said ‘No, we already finished it. I don't think they have tons and tons of food.’ 

When he stands now at the sink to watch his hands, he is very stable and spreads his feet a good distance apart to keep steady. 

He spoke multiple sentences in Spanish with Gissel Vargas. The most yet. 

Also when he realized an English word didnt come out right when talking to Jen, he apologized, looked at me and said, “Maybe you could interpret that.”
I said…”You're asking how her work is going?
He replied to me, “Yes” 
With the question now obvious to us all, he looked at Jen again and said, “Go”
It feels like he's slowly programming me for voice control like an Alexa. ☺️

We sat outside with Authiers and Howells. Had sparkling water and fresh cherries. Sitting outside in the heat takes a lot of energy, so he rested before dinner. 

His dinner came, and Ed &amp; Jenny had left me dinner too. When he saw I was gonna eat at the same time as him, he said “Vanessa, that's great!” It has bothered him that he gets a tray of food, but I dont. 

We're playing his favorite musicians everyday. It's very relaxing.

Here's a favorite of ours ☺️

We made a thank you card with two plates of Puerto Rican coconut and ginger candies to leave for the nurses station. His evening nurse said she liked them. She had been to Puerto Rico before. 

We also reviewed some homework pages that the Speech Therapist left us for the weekend. We will finish it tomorrow.

Favorite moment of the day!!! He asked me to connect the iPad to his hospital room TV, so he could watch a movie on the bigger screen. I told him I didn't know how because that's what I need him for. 😅
He said “I don't know.” Then a long minute pause…and he said “The HDMI”
I instantly teared up but I hoped because I had a mask on, he wouldnt notice and get concerned that I was crying. 😂 When I was sniffing, he said ”What happened?”
“I said, it won't seem like much, but you remembering the HDMI cable is extremely good. It's very very Shane. I need you to do more of that.”


If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. We have been praying these consistently. So maybe we can also ask Him to make it clear if he has answered this prayer. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah!!


Private:
The aide couldn't get the bed to move at an angle, to allow the chair to get by. Shane locked the wheelchair and shoved the bed with his legs. 

I couldn't remember the name of the islands we saw in Puerto Rico. Leah told me later, Icacos.
