Shane had 3 hours of therapy today. 

Also ate three full meals which he really liked. They asked if he wanted to eat, he said “Let's do it!”
The nurse said soon, we can even bring some food from outside that he likes.

We had great conversations. He asked even more questions. 

He joined the nurses when they started asking me where I'm from and what I do for work. He also spontaneously called me by my nickname, “cheekies” for the first time. 

He asked many nurses what their shift would be. He's getting more interested in what is happening and what will happen next. 

He also asked if Danny visited yesterday at 5pm. I was confused and told him no, that was Gary. But later I realized, Daniel Jacinto actually had come while he was sleeping at 4pm. And they didnt speak to each other, but he must have known he was there! 

He also asked how I would get home and how I would get back tomorrow. And how long the drive was. Also if Bethel was okay giving me a ride every morning. 

He noticed I yawned at the end of the day, and said “aw, you're tired” 

Sal visited him and he loved their conversation about AI. Sal explained that the video refreshes at 32 frames a second. Shane asked, ‘what happens at 64?” And Ben told him all about game 5 of the NBA finals when the Celtics won. He was all ears. And they watched the highlight replay together. 

Eric &amp; Garrett LaSalle also came. Shane asked Garrett, “So what's new and encouraging?”
and Garrett told him about the convention.

A night nurse yesterday asked about the Daniel drama Shane and Sam were watching. She asked if it was from the Bible book of Daniel. She said she had been reading it. Sam told her about JW.ORG. We'll try to get a link for her.

Because of this situation. So many people hear about Jehovah and see him in a new way. 💕


If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns 

1. Please help Shane have strength to do the therapy 
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah for his gift of repair and reconstruction
