He got Chick-fil-A! 🤗

The Speech Therapist, Karl, upgraded him to solid food today, including outside food. So the Taylors stopped at Chick-fil-A for him. He also ate some of the hospital dinner.

After dinner he was very content and told Sam, “Maybe I'll just take a nap. You can take a nap too if you want.” I told stories of his Bible students in Nicaragua and he later fell asleep.

Today he walked in the Physical Therapy room. 
The Physical Therapist told me he walked very straight and upright. 

He is also walking into the restroom in his room and seating himself, with a nurse standing by only if he gets off balance. He lifts himself off the bed and lays back into bed on his own strength.

He used his laptop today. He knew exactly how to use the trackpad, navigate to the taskbar and open Outlook &amp; Teams. I didn't get the Internet connected to it fast enough, so he closed the open programs and shut the laptop down. 

Yesterday afternoon, he leaned back in bed, put both arms behind his head, sighed and said 
“Oh Jehovah” 💓   When he said Jehovah's name, I glowed inside!

His nurse, Sastía, noticed he was watching the Jesus Bible Drama. She said, “So you do believe in Jesus and that he was resurrected?” I said “Yes, that's what the Bible says.” She also asked, “Do you only believe in one Bible?” 
I said, “I would use any Bible I could get my hands on, for example, if I were here in this hospital and all they had were a King James, I'd read it. And my favorite is the New World Translation, because it's easy to read.”
She said she had been told otherwise about Jehovah's Witnesses. I thanked her for letting me tell her what we believe. 

His nurse Jonathan said Shane is his favorite patient, because he's a kind patient. He's a part time firefighter and says he likes how polite Shane is. 

He expressed empathy when a friend told him that she lost her mother. 🥺

He loved his visits with Sam this week. He smiled a lot when he saw him. Sam goes home tomorrow. And Leah will stay a few extra days until Monday. 

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns 

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah for designing us so generously that we can recover even from accidents that He never meant to happen. Most inventors only invent to cover the need they see, but his designs are so adaptable that they can solve problems that were never meant to happen.
