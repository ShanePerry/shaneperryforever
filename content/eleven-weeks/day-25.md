Shane got 3.5 hours of therapy today. 

Physical therapy used the wheelchair and he went to the physical therapy room with a huge window and a view of the Hudson River.

Speech therapy helped him call my name out loud, “Vanessa” and I walked in the room on his request. The first time he says my name in 24 days.

He also repeated my name this evening at my request. 

Speech therapy also included a swallow test. He drank some sips of water, ate fruit and crackers. His first drink and food for 24 days. They will do another test tomorrow to make sure the food passes reliably to his stomach. 

They said the trach may come out tomorrow. He'd like that very much. Although he seems much more comfortable with it now that it is capped and they have treated the area around it.

He was tired from the activity. At the same time, he seemed to sleep very soundly and wake up more alert from his naps.

Shane was happy to see Sam. He recognized him and stuck out his hand so Sam would grab it.

Shane when he saw Leah had a great reaction. 
His eyes opened wide and he said:
“I know her!”
Then he grinned mischievously and teased Leah…
“Oh, no, I don't know who her is” 😅

Still no fever ☺️

Hopefully as he moves around more with physical therapy he will feel better and better. 

We created a poster board on the wall that Shane can see and we are having everyone sign it. So please don't miss that if you come see him. 


If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns 

1. Please help Shane have strength to do the therapy 
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
