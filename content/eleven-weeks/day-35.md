Today was good!

When I called him during breakfast he said, "They're gonna take the tray soon, do I need to save any of this breakfast for you?" 💙

When I arrived they transferred him to the chair for lunch. He said "I want to be over there with Vanessa" I who was looking out the window sitting on the AC unit block.

During lunch, we played Coastline by Hollow Coves. A few times he asked, “Tell me something new.” We watched a morning worship video and a recording by the Taylor family. He asked when and where they were when they recorded it.

I got out the speech therapy homework. He did 8 of the 12 items. He counted how many tasks were left to do and he was correct. Then he rested.

At one point, one of the aides was preparing him to go to the restroom. He asked, “What did we forget?” She turned around and saw the helmet, then put it on him; and he replied "good girl!"

Bro dellinger came to visit. He shared a spiritual gem about Joseph in Egypt. He quoted Joseph, “Jehovah has sent me with this purpose; to go ahead of you. And I will go ahead of you.” he said, “It's not that Jehovah did the cruel thing to Joseph, but He took advantage of it to get glory for his name and advance his purpose. Shane and Vanessa you have special assignment right now. And a unique territory.”
Shane said we don't know if this will mean a change for our service. Bro Dellinger said “It’s understandable to think about that, but right now your assignment is to get stronger and Vanessa’s is to help you.”

We got to watch some of the convention. He asked me to "turn it up." 

Alex and Moriah came to visit. Shane instantly recognized them. He is consistently recognizing everyone. Since only one person can come up with me, when Shane didn't see Mo, he asked about her. I told him the hospital rules only allow 2 visitors Mex, he said “oh, boo.” Alex talked about their time playing basketball in Mexico. Alex says he was always blocking his shots from 10 feet up. 

At dinner, I didn't have to ask about praying, he reached out his hand, took mine and said a prayer before the dinner. He was happy that someone had brought me food, because he doesn't want to eat if I haven't eaten.
We played Kingdom Melodies during dinner.


He tried to solve an internet problem on the iPad. He also skipped the commercials on YouTube. He closed it down when we were done.

Betty arrived tonight!  
Leah leaves tomorrow. 

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. We have been praying these consistently. So maybe we can also ask Him to make it clear if he has answered this prayer. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah!!
