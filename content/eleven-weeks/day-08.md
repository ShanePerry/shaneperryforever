### 9:00 AM
Shane was moving his left side more, but nothing moved on the right side yet. He had started bending his left leg at the knee letting it hang off the bed, likely to get pressure off the wound on his left foot. He couldn’t pick the leg back up and rest it on the bed again. So we spent hours with him putting his left leg off the bed and me lifting it back up onto the bed.

### 10:00 AM
I put up pictures of Shane in his suit at Bethel above the head of his bed. I thought it would help if the staff could see Shane as he was before the accident. And I put other pictures and a poster of a Caleb video on the other walls, so that Shane could see familiar things whenever he opened his eyes.

### 11:00 AM
The nurses aides said they were going to give Shane a bed bath and asked me to leave. When I came back they said, “We noticed that Shane didn’t have a beard in that picture you put up, so we shaved him!” His beard of six months was gone. I laughed inside, hoping it would grow back by the time he cared about it.

### 1:00 PM
Dr. Garret LaSalle sent a message asking if the ICU doctors would consider delaying the trach procedure to see if Shane could make the leap to breathing room air without opening the airway in his neck. The NP and RN said the trach and peg were scheduled for the next morning and brought the consent form. I asked for a consultation with the doctors before signing, wanting to carefully consider every advantage for Shane.

### 2:00 PM
Consultation with Dr. Froula, Dr. Sohail, and Dr. LaSalle via video. We asked whether a delay could benefit Shane. They said they could not guarantee he wouldn’t enter a crisis without the trach. Their recommendation remained to proceed. I prayed silently afterward and felt confident to follow the doctors caring for him daily. I signed consent for the trach and peg.

### 9:30 PM
I went back to Warwick.
