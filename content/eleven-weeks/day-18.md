A good day!

Shane got to be in the recliner from 10:00-3:00pm

Still breathing independently ☺️

They downsized the trach to prepare for the speaking cap. 

He used the smart phone for a while. Watched NFL.

Had some great visits with Andy &amp; Sherri. Uros &amp; Kati. Jules from PVG, Chris &amp; Avonda from HLC.

Today was a holiday so the rehab processing will continue tomorrow.

The message is short but the day was full of good things. Shane is recovering at top speed. 

Thank you for your prayers. They are working! Please help us ask Jehovah for these two specific things things:

For the rehab processing to go well
For Shane and me to feel calm and peace as we get to the next phase.
