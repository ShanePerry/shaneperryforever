### 9:00am
He sat up in the chair. He nodded his head when they asked if he was ok. They are using the ventilator while they transition him to sitting up. Also they turned it on in the early morning. He also started moving his right toes. Shane moved his right arm and his right toes.

### 12:00pm
He reached out his hand and spread his fingers. I put mine hand in his it. He squeezed it briefly and let it go. He spread out his hand again. I put mine in it again, but instead of squeezing it he turned his palm over to dump my hand out of his. I smiled and when he spread his palm out again, I told Betty to put her hand in his. He gripped her hand for a few minutes. It was his clear way of saying he realized his mom was there and that he appreciated her.

### 5:00pm
Gary and Christina Blackburn visited. Gary and I were standing on either side of Shane talking. We both saw him left his shoulders off the bed and point his left hand toward the trach. He couldnt reach the trach, but he got a hold of the towel the nurse rolled up to keep his head to one side. He dragged he towel out and laid it beside him. It took him so much effort to move like that. He leaned back and seemed exhausted. Gary and I wondered if what he was actually trying to remove was the trach. We told the nurse. The doctors decided to put a restraint on the left arm to prevent him from pulling the trach.
