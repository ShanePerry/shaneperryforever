### 9:00 AM
Sara Benkwitt, PA, and Susan, RN, met me with brighter expressions. Shane improved and began localizing—reaching for the handrail when moved in the lift. He was now a 7T. They planned to request EEG and MRI. His ICP bolt was removed, allowing for MRI. They reassured us he was not hopeless.

I felt like I breathed for the first time in six days. ICU staff rarely show optimism, protecting families from false hope. I saw how hard their environment was and appreciated them deeply.

Betty and I visited Shane. Sometimes it felt like he heard us, especially when he initiated breaths. The ventilator showed when he inhaled on his own. As the unit became quieter, it happened more. We partially closed the door with nurses’ approval.

### 1:00 PM
The doctor updated us: temp 98.1, antibiotics helping pneumonia. Tomorrow they would start spontaneous breathing tests (SBT). If he stayed stable, he’d be closer to getting the breathing tube out. In 1–2 weeks they aimed to have him fully off the ventilator. Once he reached GCS 8 and passed spont tests, they’d switch him to a trach, reducing pneumonia risk. A peg tube was planned soon. His primitive brain was intact though he wasn’t yet opening his eyes or following commands.

### 5:00 PM
Betty went home with Debi to rest.

### 8:30 PM
I closed the room door and softly sang *Inspired by Your Wonders* until visiting hours ended. The nurses heard me. I was embarrassed, but they said it didn’t bother anyone.
