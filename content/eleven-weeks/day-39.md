Shane
“If I cover right eye, the left eye is good. 
Cover the left eye, the right eye is ok.
Uncover them both, they are mixed up.”


Another good day.

During our 8:30am call, he asked who the gentleman is that comes and sees him. He asked if he was making decisions about his care. Later we confirmed that it was his Doctor. Dr. Seliger, the Neurologist. He does rounds early in the morning and now Shane is starting to remember his visits. He didnt think he answered all the questions right. But he did get July right today! 👏 Truthfully without a phone, most of us might only get the month right.

He did great with all the therapies today. 

In PT at 1:30
He walked in the hallway 100 feet
He walked with a walker 800 feet
He did 12 stairs
He also wheels the wheelchair himself to and from the gym. The therapist walks beside him. 


In PT at 3:30
He did a coordination activity to grab a bean bag held out at different distances and throw it into a bucket. It tests his balance while reaching out ahead of him. Also bending over to about his knee level. He did well and seemed to enjoy it. 

We went out to the garden for 30 minutes. He chose a spot with a view of the river, where there was a bench for me and Betty and a wall that he could back the wheelchair against. The temperature was perfect! But he said that sitting up after all the therapy made him extremely tired. 

Jeremy came to visit. When he walked in Shane said…”Wait who are you?” with a huge grin. 😉

He really brightened up when Jeremy talked about a project they worked on. He loved hearing how it was going. And he said “Maybe Bethel is gonna tell me, ‘Peace, enjoy your life, Shane,’ but we will just keep going until then.”

Jeremy also talked about the times he visited, but Shane said he didn't remember. He said, “I literally didn't remember anything until about a week ago. It was like I died, but here I am now.” 🥹🤗 

We had a good quiet evening, Shane asked to keep it quiet because he was getting a headache. The nurse gave him something for it. We did Bible reading and then it was the end visiting hours. The time goes by too fast. 💙

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. We have been praying consistently about it. So maybe we can also ask Him to make it clear if he has answered this prayer. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah!!


S-Hi! How are you? When are you coming? 
V-Im coming at 12:00. I took yesterday off. I didn't see you and I was sad.
S-Its ok, you can take the week off if you need to.
V-Thank you. I wanna come today. I'm coming in a few hours. How was your night?
S-Ok I think. But If you ask me how my night is and I don't even know. It's like there is nothing there. 
V-That is normal while your brain is healing the injury. There will be some blanks in your memory. But it will keep getting better.
S-So I should just keep going?
V-Yes!

S-And who is the man? I don't know who he is. Is he deciding what I need to do?
V-That's Dr Seliger. He's the main doctor. He checks you every morning.

S-Ok, that's just the way it's gonna be right now. How was your day?.....


Shane needed his shoes for 1:30 PT session and the restroom, but unfortunately I didn't know what they were. He tried to find the syllable and said hoosh. But I didn't think of it in time. When PT came they got his shoes out for him. And he said that was it.
