A great day!

He walked over 250 feet. PT was helping him on both sides, and another PT pushed the chair behind him, just in case he needed to rest. Leah and I got to watch in the hallway. He climbed stairs in the gym!

They stopped the overnight feeding. They may remove the peg tube at the end of the week. 

His left eye is opening wider and seems also to be focusing more clearly on things. 

Had a headache today, they gave him something for it. It was the first day he could describe the pain as a headache. 

He was very happy to see Leah and they talked about how to exchange negative thoughts for positive ones.

He was very happy to see his Mom. He asked how is Pops, how she got here, where she will stay, how long she will stay. He said he's sorry he's in this situation, but that the new system should make it better and if not we'll deal with it. 💕 Of course we tell him he will get better now.

He seems to find more words easily when Betty is talking to him and when he can't find the word, he  pauses, says “Wait a minute, this is backwards,” and carefully tries to choose other words.

We got to describe what happened to him, the accident, the injury and the surgeries. He was very interested, but didn't seem troubled. He was surprised that this is Day 36. He said it's strange that we don't know what caused him to fall like that. But he said he was glad it wasn't a heart attack, stroke, aneurism or seizure. And we will see later how much he can do. But he will let Jehovah help.

A few days ago the nurse's Aide who helps with bathing recognized us as having witnessed at her Fairmount apartment in Haverstraw. She saw our picture on Shane's wall and said, I knew I recognized you!

In a conversation with Betty, he realized on his own about Convention plans that got missed because of he accident.
Betty: Carolyn got baptized 
Shane: She did? *he made a sad face toward me* Sorry we missed it.
Betty: Her son and two grand boys came to watch her baptism and the son's girlfriend.
Shane: That's nice 


He grabbed both our hands and said the prayer for dinner. 

He got plenty of rest after the intense therapy. Betty realized we can close the door, since the rooms are equipped with security cameras. The nurses said they don't mind if it's closed and to call if we need anything. And he seemed much more refreshed after sleeping.

The main lobby prints out my pass ahead of time, before I even arrive. 😅 In fact, one day they had already printed out two!

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. We have been praying these consistently. So maybe we can also ask Him to make it clear if he has answered this prayer. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah!!



After dinner he got tired. We told him to sleep but he asked Betty to keep talking. He said,
“I can't fall asleep, I gotta stay awake, bonehead.” 😅

Also, when I told the story about his accident, he said, “No, that date isn't right, but it's ok, keep going” ☺️

Of course I remember the helmet. Can you help (strap it)?

Stood up and got his balance walking into the restroom.
“Come on baby”
