Another good day! 😌 

Shane's new floor is very good. He's beside two large windows. The room is very quiet and the nurse station is right there. Guest limit is still 2 people. And you wait in the Main Lobby until they agree you can come up.

They hope to begin using the speaking cap. Shane is talking as much as he can right now. He asked me a few questions and the nurse helped make it easier to hear him. It will be even easier for him with the speaking valve on. 
So we are looking forward to that.

Hemoglobin is up to 11. All vital signs are great.

The new 3rd floor Drs came in to see him this morning. They are cheerful &amp; friendly.
They put a healing patch around the trach. That seemed more comfortable for him. It irritated him less. They discussed removing the trach before rehab since he can now breath the ambient room air.

Rehab is still tentative for Tuesday/Wednesday.

No PT today, but he got more rest and watched his favorite YouTube.

He had many visits. Including Eric &amp; Ceci. Chris, Jules &amp; pvg.

And I may have kissed him back 😅 because he started it! If this is TMI, Feel free to reply UNSUBSCRIBE 😝

If you would like to help us prayer for something…

That rehab plans continue smoothly 
That Shane and I feel calm and peaceful into this next phase
