8:15 I called him, he asked “How was your night? What time did you get to bed?” We read the Day's Text. And rehearsed the date, He got the 1st, and we practiced August a few more times. He said he was ready for therapy. And that he wishes he could do more on Saturday and Sunday. So we might do what a therapist suggested and navigate the hallways to the Main Lobby, gift shop, Atrium, garden, etc. 

## 9:30-12:00
He got 5 sessions of therapy back to back. And was napping when Sherri and I came in.
She brought him blueberry muffins and a card with Ecc 11:10
“So remove troublesome things from your heart” 
We taped that on the wall. He asked if he could sleep for a bit.

1:00 Andy and I went in. He was so excited to see him. He liked Andy's beard and said, “Keep it and if you want to in six months shave it off.”
Andy showed him a picture of someone with a really long curly white beard and it cracked him up. He said, “Sorry I shouldn't laugh, but Bonehead” 😅
He also laughed when Andy said, “If the doctors plan was beauty sleep…you might need to let them know it isn't working yet.” 

He remembered that the Steens and Fullers had been traveling on assignment and was very interested to know how everything went. Andy showed him a video of the congregation singing, “Light In a Darkened World” and Shane said, “See right there with the brothers and sisters, that's where I would wanna stay, not in some fancy place.” He also said the RHCOs and other arrangements are beautiful things. He asked about certain locations getting full. Andy explained the arrangement to help with overflow. 

Andy also explained they were preparing to test the web app. And he told Shane, “You did a lot.” 
Shane said, “No you guys all did it. And I'm excited to know what's going on. Jehovah knows exactly what he wants. It's because Jehovah is moving things. If in a few weeks, even if we could just help a little bit, I'd be happy.”

He also saw pictures of a special couple in India who traveled the country in a box car, in the early days. He told Andy he wants to see all the pictures.

Kelsey Pellicone PA said that the neurosurgeon team will set up a telehealth call with us a few days after they get the next CT scan. We can consult about the upcoming surgery to replace the section of skull. The CT scan is likely next week, she said. But all dates of everything are still to-be-determined. Shane was very happy about the possible accelerated schedule for surgery and the next steps. He repeated it to everyone he saw after that. The progress really feels good.

Kelsey also removed the peg feeding tube. It gets pulled directly out of the stomach. She laid him completely flat and he tolerated it very well. He said he felt pain but he was ok. It did not bleed and she covered it with a 2x2 bandage and tape around the edges. He looked pale for about 30 minutes so I believe it hurt quite a bit. But he told them he was ok and just wanted to rest. They rescheduled his final PT session and said they can add it to Friday. 

## 4:30
He drank some water and ate a few blueberries and his color was good again.

## 5:00
I trimmed his beard and used beard oil. He said I did a good job and that I just like being nice.

## 5:30
Per and Dwayne came. They shared encouraging experiences about a expo for the blind in Florida. Also, Per showed us pictures and a video of a goldfinch that ate from his hand at Patterson.

## 6:00
He ate a little less at dinner but didn't talk about any pain from the feeding tube site. Steve and Massiel Ward joined us. And he loved hearing how the congregation was doing. They said they pray for Shane often at the meetings. That made him happy. We have more publishers, now so Shane asked about the chances of splitting. There aren't plans for it.

7:00 We watched a movie about Chocolate and he ate a chocolate protein bar. 

7:45 He told me and the Howells to get home a little early and he would fall asleep.

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah!

Shane looked pale and laid on his side for 45 minutes. When anything got near his stomach he said, “be gentle”
