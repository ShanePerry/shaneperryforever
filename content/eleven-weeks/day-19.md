Another good day!

Shane is moving to Neuro step down tonight. 

The plans continue for Helen Heyes rehab Tuesday or Wednesday, pending approval.

Shane stood with PT sat in the recliner 10:00-4:30

Breathing the wall o2. And sometimes without that, just natural room air.

Celestina the bethel nurse says blood tests are good. Hemoglobin up to 9.6. 

Swelling on his head is way down. No fever. 

He loved seeing Jeremy and Youn today. He put back on Andy's hat 💕 Had a visit and spiritual gem from Chris Fairley. 

He turned himself in the bed on his own. To sleep on his right side. The staff said it's fine and watched his O2 stay good. It's the most comfortable I've seen him sleep for almost 3 weeks. 

He kissed me goodbye on my head when I bent over to hug him. First kiss in 19 days 😅

Nurse said he will be on 3rd floor by the morning. 

If you would like to help us prayer for something…

That rehab plans continue smoothly 
That Shane and I feel calm and peaceful into this next phase


Helen Heyes
Sarath sent the letter saying 
He is a volunteer 
Not a salared employee 
Would not be covered under workman's comp
