### 9:00 AM
Shane was still a GCS 7. He was moving his left side more, and nothing on the right side.

### 10:00 AM
Olivia arrived. The Airbnb and car rental hadn’t worked out well. Last‑minute accommodations were arranged.

### 2:00 PM
Cecibel Loff and I massaged Shane. A pressure wound on his left foot had opened. Wound care dressed it, but his feet kept hitting the bed. They had already extended the bed and even considered a longer one, but the ICU room couldn’t fit it.

### 3:45 PM
Spont test started. The respiratory tech, Megan Gonzalez, recognized Shane’s medical directive bracelet and said she was a Witness too. Her reassuring comments about Shane’s rapid progress encouraged us. I connected her with commuting sisters.

### 9:00 PM
While saying goodnight, I became emotional. It sounded like Shane turned his head slowly toward me. When I went to his other side and asked him to open his eyes, his left eyelid lifted slightly. He did it two more times. I recorded it even though videos weren’t allowed, then deleted and undeleted it. I told the others waiting for me: “Shane just opened his eyes!” It was a moment of overwhelming joy.

### 10:00 PM
Andrea, Francesca Re, and Rebecca were waiting by the B‑residence sidewalk. I told them the news — it was a great night.
