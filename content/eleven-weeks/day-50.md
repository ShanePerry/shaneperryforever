Called Shane. He rested well. When I told him it is the 5th, he said “Yes and they are gonna start the big ones today.” He meant that more physical therapy was planned.

He remembered that Jonathan the nurse is going on a cruise. And he remembered exactly which day he would leave.

## 9:00-12:00
He had 5 sessions and was resting at noon when I arrived.

Dr. Edward came to do an evaluation. Shane also asked how the Dr. is doing and the Dr. said Shane is the first person who asked him that today. He asked Shane what he could remember from the therapy sessions from the morning. Shane described speech and physical therapy.

Shane still says his vision is not right. The nurse made a record to ask the Dr. and Therapists about. 

## 12:30-2:00
Nap block

## 2:00
OT
PT
He got the right leg brace, to remind him to raise the right foot more. He did well with it. He steps over hurdles. This time they asked him to tap the top of the hurdle as he went. That required a pause and more balance. He was very conversational the whole session, so he was not winded. That means the nap block is doing the job.

## 2:30
Kelsey Pellicone PA said Dr. Wainwright's PA will contact her to schedule the telehealth appointment once they have the CT scan. 

## 4:00
Shane remembered his Fitbit was out of battery. So he asked me to charge it. We watched video of the upcoming CT scan. 
Shane noticed that the clock on the wall stopped and asked me to get the battery changed. Christopher the nurse helped us find a new battery.

## 5:00
We worked on the whiteboards and watched tv. 

## 7:45
Bible reading and a prayer. Another great day!

## 9:00
Leah arrived!

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah!




Private:
Dr Seliger &amp; Hall started antidepressant to help with motor recovery, energy and to prevent low mood.

Shane said he remembered the brothers (therapists) and he tries to help them. And theres the one who helps him put stuff into his mind.

Nick, Shane's neighbor, lives near Watchtower. He said he has always wanted to hunt on the land. He even says he's asked permission from the security guard who sits in the truck on Red Mill Rd 😁
