He had a good but intense morning session of PT/OT

Speech therapy worked on writing today. He signed his name. They gave us a few bonus writing pages to work on over the weekend since sessions are reduced those two days. 

The clerk in Wing 3A, Shirley, came and told us that she goes to the Stoney Point congregation. 😅😅 We had no idea. She's been helping us for 1.5 weeks. But today was the first time that she noticed the Caleb and Sofia poster. 👏 She said when she saw that, she knew we were witnesses.

He played the card game War with the therapist and he knew which card takes which, without any explanation necessary. Then he learned a new card game called Trash.

Hayley boiled him two fresh corn on the cob, from the Wallkill harvest. We added butter and salt. He Loved the corn.

He got an upgrade on food menu, he gets a main dish like spaghetti and meatball sauce and then a side of a ham sandwich. He can have as much as he wants. He's also still getting a high protein dose via the peg overnight to promote healing. But they are saying the at some point he won't use the peg anymore.

His leg muscles look strong again. 

He is still lifting himself from the side of the bed  and walking to and from the restroom on his own strength. One nurse or two always join him in case he needs help with balance. He hasn't needed help yet. 

He also explained during a few different visits with the Burns, the Colons and Momo &amp; Tammy that in the future, he will have surgery to replace the part of the bone that was removed.

Marc came to visit and Shane asked where Anita was. The therapist made a joke as she left that Shane stayed laying down the whole time that she was there, but when he heard Marc's voice at the door, he immediately sat the bed upright, to greet him. 

He liked having guy talk. He liked stories about their upcoming trip down the Delaware river. When Marc got up to leave, Shane remembered that Marc had set something on the table, so he reminded him not to forget it. It was a card for us, so Marc did leave it there. 

We plan to go outside tomorrow to enjoy the great weather. 👏


If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. We have been praying these consistently. So maybe we can also ask Him to make it clear if he has answered this prayer. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah!! 



Shirley said he got up to use the restroom one time by himself. When they went to walk with him he had already gotten there on his own.

“You Tell them I can't do therapy. I'm gonna sleep.”

He looked at me and told the therapist that we have arrangements, then she asked me and I said we have no commitments. He said, you just totally disagreed with me.
