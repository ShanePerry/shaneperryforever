Another good day

Shane had 3 hours of therapy. They used the rails in the gym to get him walking on his own.

He also began transfers to the bathroom in his room. Two nurses stand on each side of him, he lifts himself up from the side of the bed and takes steps on his own into the restroom. The nurses are there on both sides in case he needs help steadying himself. 

He was happy to see Jonathan Shaffer. He recognized him and that he works in PT in Bethel. He asked about Jonathan's work schedule and said “welcome to our gym.” ☺️ A few times it seemed like Shane was asking if Jonathan would be checking in on him.
Coincidentally, Jonathan used to work in this same unit in Helen Hayes before coming to Bethel. 😄

The nurses got him into the wheelchair after all his therapy sessions were done and we went outside again. We sat in the gazebo with Sam, Jonathan, Ian, Kharis. It was a great conversation. Shane asked everyone what they normally did on a Monday. And asked a few time what the PT guys’ schedules were like.

At 6:00pm after Sam left, Kharis came back up into Shane's room and Shane said, “Nice to see you again” It was excellent to see the short term memory kicking in. 

He also remembered that Leah hadn't been feeling well and when I said that she may come visit soon, he said, “If she feels better’

We watched the Bethel Watchtower study with Kharis. He saw Kharis’ laptop, pointed and asked “Whose is that?” ☺️ A Mac book pro, never escapes his notice.

His evening nurse let us show her how to watch the Daniel drama on her phone. She said had already searched JW.ORG on Friday because Sam told her about it, but hadn't seen that you can filter the search results by clicking VIDEOS. She had overheard Shane and Sam watching the drama a few days ago and said she was just reading that exact Bible book, and recognized what the video was about. Tonight she asked if there are videos of other Bible characters. 🙏
We told her about Jesus, Jonah, Nehemiah.
She says she loves research and she learned that in the Daniel Nebuchadnezzar's dream, part of the image represents Greece. 

Because of this experience, many people are hearing Jehovah's name!

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns 

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please help the therapists to show Shane ways to prevent falls in the future
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah for designing us so generously that we can recover even from accidents that He never meant to happen. Most inventors only invent to cover the need they see, but his designs are so adaptable that they can solve problems that were never meant to happen.
