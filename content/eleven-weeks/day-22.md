A good day!

Shane stood up from the edge of the bed with PT again. I actually got to see it ☺️ He stood and pivoted to the recliner. He sat for a while, and held the toothbrush and used it himself but wanted to go back to the bed. 

Once he was back in the bed, I told him how great it was that he got up and moved over and back, even though he didn't stay in the recliner very long (it's too small for him) He told me “don't worry” 😅

He spoke some Spanish with brothers from our congregation. When he forgot some of the words, he said “I'm sorry” 💗 and they switched to English.

The Drs said he's ready from a medical standpoint for rehab. The case worker says potentially Wednesday, he will be transferred.

Watched more dramas and shows he likes.

He's asking more questions about things, when we will leave and about what the nurses will allow. The nurse asked him if he knew why he was in the hospital. He paused and said, “because something bad happened”

Speech therapy hopefully comes tomorrow for the speaking valve.

We went through pictures and I named all our friends. He seems to recognize people he knows, but can't immediately put a finger on the names.

He got good rest today. Sleeping on his side lets him wake up more refreshed. 

If you want to help us pray, these are the top things,

That rehab plans continue smoothly 
That Shane and I feel calm and peaceful into this next phase
