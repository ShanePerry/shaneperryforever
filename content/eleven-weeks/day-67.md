Called Shane. He was feeling very good. He said he watched the sunrise. They brought in breakfast and they said they could bring it back to him when he finished the phone call. He said, “No, that's fine. I'll eat it now … There's good stuff in there.” 😅

Karl, Shane's speech therapist, set up for us to meet tomorrow during the afternoon therapy session. I'll give that information to the Warwick Infirmary and the sister who will continue the therapy. 

A young Lebanese man got to walk today for the first time in 5 months. He had been in a dirt bike accident. His family was very happy to see him walk. The team of three lady physical therapists worked hard to get him up and steady, but once he realized he was up, he seemed to remember exactly what to do. 

Also, Nick, Shane's former roommate, messaged that he will get another leg surgery. But that mentally he feels like he's doing much better. 

### 4:00
Westchester Medical Center requested Shane's pdf for the bloodless medicine he will accept. That was already faxed to them but it's good they are attentive to it. The surgery date appears in the website now.

Benji the aide, a kind 50 year old woman from India, brought Shane's dinner. He told her he hopes that she can come visit us when we get home. She said if we give her the address, she will come. 😊

Gabrielle came up with dinner and Shane was so pleased that I was gonna get something to eat then. He didn't like eating his dinner if I didn't have mine. 

### 7:00
Shane asked Josh if he had 15 minutes to do Bible reading with us. Josh teased that he could read Shane an extremely long Psalm out loud. Shane said, “You could, if you wanted to, but it's better for the people outside.” 😅
Josh reminisced about working with some of the older brothers in Brooklyn. And Shane said he remembered working as a personal care assistant for Brother Schroeder. I reminded him of an interesting story Shane told before about a moment when Brother Schroeder asked him, “Could there be any other issues in the universe like the one of Jehovah's Sovereignty?” At that time, Shane went to another experienced brother who said, “Jehovah wrote the Bible with the necessary things to explain the biggest issue for humans, that of Jehovah's Sovereignty. That is the one of greatest importance to us.”


## If you want to help us pray for something, these are our main concerns 💓

1. Please help us Thank Jehovah for Shane's excellent recovery and for giving us opportunities to praise him because of this experience. 👏

2. Please ask for Jehovah's spirit to help any seeds of truth to grow from this stay on Helen Hayes. Shane and I want to treat this like our final week in unassigned territory.

3. Please if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, help us know the original cause of the fall. And please help us feel peace when/if the prayer has been answered.

Shane asked Josh and Gabrielle to watch a movie with us. I chose Downton Abbey. In a few minutes all of us were checking something on our phones and Shane looked up and said, “Oh, I'm the only one watching it. I don't have one of those.”
