Another good day 😊 

He stood again and took two steps. He lead with his left leg while the right leg supported him.

And Shane spoke! ☺️
Speech therapy came and tested a speaking valve on the trach. He answered various questions saying:
“Ahhh”
“Yes”
“Ok”
“I think New Jersey” (when she asked where he was)

I am so happy about this! The first time I hear his voice in 2 weeks. 

They will reduce the size of the trach tube from 8 to 6 to allow for a speaking cap that doesn't cause back pressure (a build up of CO2)

They removed the ventilator from the room. He is independent from it now. He's still doing well on the O2 from the wall. 

Helen Heyes rehab processing is started. We still have a few details to sort out. Also we sent a request to two more facilities as back up.

He sat in the recliner from 10:00-2:00.

He wore his glasses and turned pages in a magazine with his left hand. 

Also got a visit from Gary Blackburn. He told him jokes and stories about camping and wood working knives. He loved the guy conversation 😂 after days of me and the nurses. 

We had a good call with his parents at 8:00pm. He smiled a lot when they told him stories and they made jokes. Betty and Bill said they've been loving the phone calls. Including the calls from 
people who work with Shane. 

A nurse tonight said Shane has recovered because of God. And that it is a “testament to our faith.” She said she's been watching how we support him continually.

Please help us pray for a good result with the rehab process. HE has done so much for us, we know he won't leave us now. 

Thank you 💕
