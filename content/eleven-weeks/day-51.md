Called Shane. He asked about Leah, if she arrived and stayed with me last night. He said, if he naps today Leah and I should go somewhere and do something together. He also said once he and I are back in Bethel together, that while he goes to Physical Therapy, I could go work at the office. 

## 9:00-12:00
Four therapy sessions

## 12:00-1:30
Nap

We realized the CT scan will be at Good Samaritan on Friday, not at Westchester. I didn't notice the GSH stands for Good Sam in appointment confirmation in the Westchester portal. The surgery will be at Westchester, the date of that is still to be determined. 

Karl the speech therapist gave us an update, and said Shane always asks about Karl’s son. During therapy he asks Shane to look at two different pictures at the same time and have him explain them. And also to isolate differences between them. Today he increased it to multiple pictures at a time so Shane can explain what the pictures are about.

Shane saw Leah come in with me and he is very happy she came. They made jokes the whole day. She put on the new Celtics hat that she and Sam bought for him. He smiled huge when he knew it was for him. He said he will wear it and the Celtics shirt, but that he knows he can't wear it everywhere. My guess is he is thinking about avoiding logos in Bethel. ☺️

OT
PT
He walked with the brace. And he walked with and without the walker. He looked very steady and comfortable. Laurell said they will gradually increase the time he wears the brace, to let his skin adjust to having it around his calf. And when he can wear it for more time and his balance is good, then she'll train me to help him walk to the restroom, instead of using the wheelchair.

## 4:00
He congratulated Nick, the young man who shares the room with him because he will go home on Friday. Nick invited us to visit if we are ever near Wallkill. He says he lives a few minutes from Watchtower and has always wanted to hunt on the land. He even says he's asked permission from the security guard who sits in the truck on Red Mill Rd. ☺️ He said they are always nice to him but always say no. We don't know if Shane will get a neighbor after that. 

## 5:00
We watched Brother Aladys morning worship about memory. He really liked that. 

## 6:30
He enjoyed listening to Eduardo Lavin talk about HuB at dinnertime. He said some bugs are garbage. 

## 7:30
We did Bible reading and an evening prayer. He wanted us to get those early because of the storm. 

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah!



Shane remembered putting earplugs in his pocket 

He noticed that today Leah wore the black mask and I wore a white mask. He pointed to Leah's black mask said “You wore that before”

Karl included a picture of a man with road rage and Shane described it as a man who was upset. We told Karl that Shane described him as the guy who helps me put stuff in my mind. 

He loves the Celtics hat. He asked if he could use that instead of the helmet.

I marked the day off the calendar and told him that tomorrow is the 7th. I held up my hand and showed him five fingers…he said “Five”, without me asking him. Then I held up two. And told him that was seven
