### 4:00 AM
I woke up early. I asked Jehovah, if Shane was going to need help with speech again, and if it could help having the person who taught him to speak in the first place, Betty, could He touch the heart of Bill, as a father, to make a sacrifice and accept any help she could find. The next time we could explain it to Shane, wouldn’t he be pleased to hear his dad made a huge unselfish sacrifice for him.

### 9:00 AM
Shane was completely off sedation. He was still 100% on the ventilator. The ICP at 13 was an improvement and all other vitals were within range. But he made no response, so GCS was at a 3.

* Profound unresponsiveness
* No purposeful movement
* No eye opening
* No verbal output

Tiffany the nurse said if there was any response to be gotten out of Shane, she knew how to do it. I never knew exactly what her method was, but I believed her. She said he hadn’t given any response yet. That was disheartening. I said that despite his size, he was surprisingly sensitive to medication, even low doses. A dose of Ni-quil would set him back 16 hours. He would need much more time to come back around from these strong medications.

Some areas around the metal staples were less red and inflamed. It showed that healing had started. Even if it was only on the surface, it was a start.

### 10:00 AM
Betty called me. She said she woke up at 7:00am and Bill told her to find a caregiver and that she should go help Shane. I was speechless. No one knew about my early morning prayer except me and Jehovah. She said Debi Dotson told her she would drop everything and drive her to New York. She asked how soon she should come, I said as soon as possible to prevent any of these fragile details from slipping away. It felt like Jehovah had just made eye contact.

### 3:00 PM
Hemoglobin 8.7. We had a visit from Chris Fairley from HLC:


**“Jehovah does not forget your work” Hebrews 6:10**

Even if it feels like you are doing less at some moment, Jehovah loves you and will not stop caring about you. You will not be neglected. God is not unrighteous. Shane is still working. Giving glory to Jehovah.
Now in the hospital there are twenty or thirty people who never would have heard of Jehovah.
Now they could get everlasting life. What if 5 million years from now someone says....”hey Shane you helped me.”
5 million years from now, this small fraction of time will feel like a moment. Like a hair on the football field. Could you even find it? Once that time goes by, we won't remember these traumatic events. Just like we don't remember the first traumatic event of our life, the day we were born. These memories will also fade. We won't even call it to mind.

### 5:00 PM
Janelle the infirmary nurse said not much information was available at night. Emma had tried but no one else could get updates. If the hospital needed to, they would call me directly.
