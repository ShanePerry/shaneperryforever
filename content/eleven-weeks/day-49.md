Called Shane. He rested well. When he gets words he doesn't intend to, he realizes it's not the one he wants and reattempts them 👏
For example, he said he will finish the speech therapy homework…. "This week, No, I mean Today”

He is using other really great transition phrases like:
The fact of the matter is...
The long story short...
The truth is...

Andrew Sabbath drove me and he went up to visit Shane. They had a chat about the Celtics and watching the game 5 highlights next Saturday evening, when he and Katie come. He also explained some points from the convention. That Mark is not condensed, it's compelling. Written for the Roman audience, who wouldn't have needed the sermons and explanations that a Jewish audience did. They needed to know how Jesus valued what was in someone's heart, even if they had improvements to make, like Mr 10:21 Jesus “felt love for him” the rich young ruler.

The nurse changed the bandages. The peg tube site looks great. His feet are healing nicely too.

He asked if I wanted to go downstairs. We went to the garden. I brought him a snack of steak that Carlos &amp; Margarita had sent with GC a few days ago. When he heard they had sent it, he asked “oh, so they aren't gonna come by today?” He remembered that the night before we told him they were going to visit soon. His short term memory is really doing well. 

## 3:00
He finished the weekend homework and a nap

## 5:00-6:00
The Hummel's and the Hubbard's came to visit. No one in that hospital gets more love and care than Shane!

Tom Quinn came to visit Shane. He flew in from Missouri today and Uros and Kari drove him over. Shane Loved the visit. It was their first time seeing each other in person. 🥹
Tom said Shane's progress is impressive. And we should keep it up.

He recommended using these techniques to stimulate memory:
Look up to the right to find a word
Look up to the left to recall a visual memory 
Look down to the left to recall a audio memory

We will practice these tomorrow.

If you want to help us pray for something these are our main concerns. 💓

1. Please, if it's necessary to prevent a future fall, please help us know the original cause of the fall.
2. Please ask Jehovah to guide the Doctors’ plans for Shane's next surgery.
3. Please help us Thank Jehovah!



Private:

For example I told him again about Kristie and Troy, and that poor Troy had a heart attack. Because I wanted to tell him the coincidence that our dear friends Aaron &amp; Grace Hardesty from Patterson are friends of theirs. And they are with her right now.

Shane understood it all and asked if Troy ‘was planning on death.” He meant, did they know something was wrong. I told him it was a total shock.
