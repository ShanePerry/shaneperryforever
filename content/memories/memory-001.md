Shane was switched to my congregation in Marble Hill, NY. He asked, "Bro, am I gonna stand out as the only big tall white guy?" I said, "No, you'll be fine. But yea, you'll be the only white guy." 

His first Sunday, we took the train together to the territory before service. As we came down the platform to the city street, a man in a 4 story building shouted, "Ima kill you, you white devil," and threw an empty beer bottle at Shane. 

In the chaos we didn't see Shane anymore. We looked behind us and saw him headed back up the staircase to the train, taking the stairs 3 at a time.
