## A Memory of Shane

**From:** Anonymous-Contributed at Shane's Memorial  
**Date:** 2024-08-28 Saturday


I went with Shane to a convention when we were single serving in Brooklyn. I saw a girl I really wanted to talk to but I was intimidated. Shane said, “Dude, it's not hard.”

He walked up to her and started a conversation, then I joined, and he slowly backed out and left us talking.

She and I are still married today.
