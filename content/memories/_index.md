### How this page works
- New posts you add under `content/memories/` will automatically appear here.
- You can tag posts (e.g., `tags = ["family", "speaking", "2017"]`) and they’ll render with your theme’s tag styles.
- To include a YouTube video in an individual memory, add this shortcode inside that memory’s Markdown body:

  {{< youtube VIDEO_ID >}}

- Place images under `static/images/memories/` and reference them like:

  ![Caption](/images/memories/filename.jpg)
