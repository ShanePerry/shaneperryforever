<!-- Type the memory below. Keep the original wording whenever possible. -->

I went with Shane to a convention when we were single serving in Brooklyn Bethel. I saw a girl I really wanted to talk to but I was intimidated. Shane said, “Dude, it’s not hard.”

He walked up to her and started a conversation, then I joined, and he slowly backed out and left us talking.

She and I are still married today.
