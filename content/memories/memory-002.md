Shane and I had just gotten engaged at Gas Works Park in Seattle Washington after the Saturday program at the Tacoma District Convention. Afterwards, Dad and Mom invited us and Leah to dinner at IL Bistro in Pike Place Market. 

Shane said he was nervous to eat with his future Father-In-Law. When the waiter came, he ordered the cheapest thing on the menu because he didnt know Dad's budget. He also secretly hoped it was big because he was hungry. Everyone else placed their orders and Dad ordered last. He got the rack of lamb. 

When Shane's order came, he was bummed because it was just 4 small ravioli. He said he learned his lesson. Always let the host order first, because then he'd have known he could have gotten the $60 rack of lamb, instead of the $10 plate of ravioli.
